Generally, we expect BWXT to finish and be paid for any reactor the Navy has commissioned. However, anticipated subsequent commissions could be delayed for the reasons stated. We view this as \"not if but when\" but forecasts could be negatively effected just the same.\nUnless the global political landscape radically de-emphasizes the need for nuclear deterrence and rapid deposition of warfare assets we find it highly unlikely U.S. Navy demand for BWXT's propulsion systems will diminish.\nIt is theoretically possible that BWXT will make a manufacturing mistake that will damage its relationship with the Navy. However, in 70+ years of work together this has yet to take place.\nIn its commercial division, we see risk primarily in Bruce Power's ongoing effort to build 4.8GW of new nuclear power generation and growing demand for BWXT manufacture of SMRs. Right now, governments believe that electricity demand will exceed historical levels for several decades to come, particularly from electrification of transportation, datacenter growth, AI adoption, and the possible legitimization of crypo currencies. Nuclear power is experiencing a renaissance because it can meet these demand needs without emitting climate changing gasses.\nShould this view of power demand change radically, perhaps from something dramatic like a global recession, growth of nuclear power could be challenged.\nIn BWXT Medical, the main risks, in our opinion, would be regulatory. If its Tc-99 generation method is not approved by the FDA or if the Ac-225 trials that it is supporting fail this would blunt growth in the division in the near and possibly medium terms.\n",

As more boutique advisory firms have gone public to pursue more aggressive growth strategies, there is greater competition for talent and deal flow within the strategic advisory and restructuring businesses. This can lead to higher compensation expenses or loss of talent, or both.\nMacroeconomic Risk. M&A and other strategic advisory activities are highly cyclical, with appetite for M&A among corporate buyers typically falling materially during recessions or other forms of economic and market stress. In turn, this can negatively impact strategic advisory fees.\nEarnings Volatility. There are no long-term recurring revenue streams in the advisory business, and thus revenue and earnings can be volatile around the timing of advisory assignments closing (when the majority of fees are collected). Coupled with significant cyclicality and sensitivity to other macro events, earnings volatility among boutique advisory firms is high. However, we see PJT as having the lowest cyclical risk given its sizable exposure to the countercyclical restructuring business (~40% of revenue), more cross-cycle stability of placement fees (~20% of revenue). and idiosynchratic growth in strategic advisory.\nRegulatory, legal, and Reputational Risk. We don't view regulatory or legal risk as particularly high in the advisory business, although there is always the risk of fraud on the part of corporate clients or advisory personnel, which can result in monetary penalties and reputational damage (which could result in client attrition).\nPricing Risk Modest. Given the episodic nature of M&A and its significant impact on the strategic outlook for a company, we have seen little-to-no degradation in advisory fees over the past 20 years.

        "Risks": "Sector growth. We believe that the food service equipment industry is growing due to favorable industry fundamentals including low unemployment, improving consumer spending levels, emerging market growth, innovative technology, more meals prepared outside of the home, new product innovation and energy efficiency. Based on these factors, we expect the food service equipment industry to grow 2% to 4% CAGR. However, a U.S. or International economic recession could cause the food equipment sector to decline.\nRestructuring the Residential segment may take longer than expected. MIDD management made strategic investments into the residential kitchen equipment market, which has been a volatile new segment due to restructuring. The Viking (in the USA) business has been restructured and the AGA (in Europe) business continues to get restructured, but the sales growth and operating profits remain below average. Due to AGA’s Europe sales, or problems with restructuring, MIDD’s Residential business may fail to grow or become more profitable.\nSeasonality. Revenues are skewed towards the second and third quarters, when MIDD's sales are historically higher than in the North American winter months. Equipment is typically replaced in the summer construction season when restaurant and renovations are scheduled.\nDependence on key customers. MIDD sells products to a highly diversified and fragmented customer base. However, some large restaurant chains such as McDpnalds, Papa John’s Pizza, Dunkin, KFC, Pizza Hut, Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Red Lobster, Panera may reduce food equipment spending due to volatility in same-store sales. This can adversely affect the business and the company’s existing operations.\nAcquisition risk. MIDD has stepped up M&A with seven recent deals including the $1B Taylor acquisition. In our view, MIDD management is experts are cutting costs at newly acquired companies and increasing the growth rate through synergies. However, the recent acquisitions may fail in cost cutting or sales synergies.\nCompetition. MIDD operates and sells its products in a highly competitive industry. MIDD competes based on product design, quality of products, quality of product support, product performance, reliability, maintenance and price. Many competitors have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and distribution resources than MIDD. These could cause sales to decrease, force MIDD to cut prices or even incur additional costs to stay competitive. All of these options would negatively impact the financial condition of the company.\nInnovative products. To remain in a competitive position among its peers, MIDD must continue to develop new and innovative food equipment. MIDD must invest in new product development, and stay at the forefront of new consumer trends. If MIDD does not develop new and innovative products it will be very difficult to maintain market share and sales.\nCurrency fluctuations. Many operational activities are conducted by subsidiaries in foreign countries. The base currency is reported in US dollars with its operations and financial positions transacted foreign currencies. This leaves foreign currency against the US dollar subject to fluctuation, which can be volatile. These fluctuations could cause a material effect on MIDD’s operational and financial results.\nCommodity prices. MIDD is exposed to commodity price fluctuations that have the ability to vary over time and adversely affect margins. MIDD normally hedges commodity prices used in manufacturing food equipment. The commodities used include steel, stainless steel, aluminum, copper, and electronic controls. Through the hedging program, the company fixes a portion of the commodity prices used in its production process. Commodity prices may not result in cost stability.\nUnderfunded pension. Due to recent international acquisitions MIDD is facing a large pension deficit. Low asset returns, low discount rates and extended life longevity of the participants could cause the pension liability to increase. We believe the pension obligation will not significantly affect operating results.\n",

The remainder of this segment is primarily refractory materials for the steel industry, which can face volatility similar to the metalcasting market based on industrial production. Within Specialty Additives, production levels for uncoated freesheet paper in North America and Europe, MTX's two largest markets, are projected to continue to decline as consumers shift away from using paper in classrooms or at the workplace.\nRegulatory risk. MTX is subject to extensive regulations around environmental, health, and safety that could restrict its ability to operate or impose higher costs on its operations. Certain customers are subject to increased regulations relating to environmental, health, and safety matters, notably in Energy Services. MTX's manufacturing processes use a significant amount of energy, particularly in the PCC process, and should new legislation cause energy prices to increase, MTX may have difficulty passing through the increased costs.\nContract risk. MTX's sales of PCC to paper customers tend to have long-term agreements that are initially ten years in length with paper mills where MTX operates satellite PCC plants.

Economic slowdowns, geopolitical tensions, and shifts in global trade policies are potential risks that could impact industrial activity and, consequently, Dover's business. A slowdown in the US manufacturing sector, indicated by weakening demand, has reduced demand for industrial products, posing a risk to Dover's financial performance. Effective risk management and strategic planning are essential to navigate these challenges and sustain growth.\nInternational risks such as international politics, environments risk regulations and tariffs: Dover Corporation (DOV) derives about 40% of its revenue from countries outside the US. Consequently, its manufacturing and trade operations abroad face numerous international risks, including political, social, and economic instability. The Clean Energy & Fueling segment, in particular, must comply with diverse environmental laws and is vulnerable to political changes in oil-rich regions and countries with significant manufacturing activities. Dover's global supply chain and market presence also make it highly susceptible to changes in tariffs and trade policies. Stricter regulations in Europe (+20%), where Dover has a strong presence, may require additional investments in green technologies and compliance measures.\nSupply Chain Disruptions and Inventory Normalization: Dover Corporation has navigated challenges related to both supply chain disruptions and post-COVID backlog normalization. Supply chain disruptions continue to pose risks, including dependence on key suppliers, logistical hurdles, and global trade issues, potentially impacting product delivery timelines. However, there's positive news on the inventory front. Entering 2024, Dover's Precision Components segment has successfully achieved inventory levels that are now largely in line with current demand. Additionally, the long-term outlook for this segment remains bright, with prospects for single-use bioprocessing and cell and gene therapies continuing to improve.\nCommodity Price and Labour: Dover's manufacturing costs could be significantly impacted by fluctuations in the prices of raw materials. The company is exposed to commodity risks, particularly in its reliance on various raw materials, including metals such as steel and aluminum, which are subject to price volatility. Additionally, labor strikes or disputes with unions could disrupt production and increase costs. The shortage of qualified labor can lead to increased labor expenses, as Dover may need to offer higher wages and additional benefits to attract and retain employees. These factors combined can affect Dover's operational costs and profitability.\n",

        "Risks": "Macro slowdown/deterioration. Although the auto retailers tend to be less cyclical than their OEM and supplier peers due to the somewhat counter-cyclical nature of their Service & Parts businesses (the greatest contributor to their Gross Profit) and their more flexible cost structures, they are still susceptible to economic volatility.\nAccelerating shift to EVs. Despite claims to the contrary, we believe that the shift to EV could prove detrimental to the Auto Retailers Service & Parts business. In fact, highly regarded Consumer Reports recently published the results of a study which showed that lifetime maintenance and repair costs for EVs and PHEVs were 50% lower than those for ICE vehicles ($4,600 vs. $9,200):\n\n\nThis could impact the dealers as the Service & Parts business 1) is typically the most recession-resistant of all their businesses and 2) comprises the greatest proportion of gross profit. Thus, a decline in Service & Parts revenue could both diminish the overall profitability of these companies, and make them more cyclical. That said, there are mitigating factors such as 1) the continued significant increase in vehicle complexity with increased electronic content and electrification, could enable the dealers to capture an increasing proportion of total Service and Parts revenue, and 2) with EV penetration in the US and globally now in just the low single digit range, the path to significant EV penetration is likely to be a long one, giving this group many years to adjust and adapt. Note that increased vehicle complexity has helped drive mid-single digit revenue growth for nearly all the dealers for the past several years and it is expected to continue.\nSlowing of/an inhospitable M&A environment. Given their significant free cash flow generation, one of the reliable avenues for growth for Auto Retailers has been M&A. For example, many of these companies are strong cash generators which often deploy that cash to acquire stores to generate growth. Thus, to the extent that the M&A environment becomes less friendly, either via fewer/less willing sellers, higher prices, or both – this could unfavorably impact growth plans. That said, while interest in selling amongst smaller operators was robust even pre-pandemic as many of them faced generational succession issues, interest has reportedly spiked higher post-pandemic as many small operators have found it difficult to compete with larger dealer groups as their resources, online capabilities, etc. pale in comparison -- very similar to the dynamics in the dining and broader retail sectors where the largest entities are thriving while smaller ones face difficulty keeping pace.\nHigher U.S. tax rates. As these companies are very profitable, the auto retailers were large beneficiaries of the reduction in U.S tax rates a few years ago (for examples, PAG effective tax rate declined from 32.6% in 2017 to 24.3% in 2018). Thus, the potential for higher tax rates under a new administration could be punitive to the auto retailers given their significant profit bases and having few, if any, Deferred Tax Assets to mitigate the impact.\nStall in Finance & Insurance revenue growth. The continued unrelenting growth of F&I revenue (well beyond what many investors believed was possible) has essentially offset the secular compression in new and used vehicle margins such that “front-end yields” have remained relatively stable. However, ff vehicle margins continue to compress and F&I revenue growth stalls, both revenue and earnings for the group would be impacted unfavorably.\n",

        "Risks": "Economic risk: A slowdown in the U.S. or global economy, particularly in key end markets such as fluid and metering technologies, health and science technologies, and fire and safety products, could materially reduce IDEX Corporation’s sales and profitability. The current economic downturn in Europe and China, coupled with the lack of availability of business and consumer credit, poses significant challenges. Any further economic decline could negatively affect the company’s operations and financial performance. Additionally, the lagging industrial and biopharma sectors have adversely impacted IDEX's financials. Due to the volatility of the current economic climate, customers in these sectors may face financial difficulties, leading to decreased sales, reduced cash flows, and delayed operations for IDEX.\nInternational risk: IDEX's global reach, with nearly half its sales coming from international markets, presents a double-edged sword. While it offers substantial revenue, it also exposes the company to a range of geographic risks. In today's climate of escalating global tensions, stringent environmental regulations, and persistent trade conflicts, these risks are heightened. The Ukraine war has disrupted supply chains and food security, impacting IDEX's operations. Stricter environmental regulations and ongoing trade conflicts could further complicate matters. By monitoring these evolving risks, IDEX can take proactive steps to navigate the international market effectively.\nAcquisition Risk: IDEX Corporation's growth strategy heavily relies on pursuing strategic acquisition opportunities, which come with significant challenges and risks. High integration costs and efforts from acquisitions can hurt business performance, causing integration issues, management distraction, and surprise liabilities. Acquisitions also involve the risk of undisclosed liabilities, difficulties in assimilating operations, technologies, services, and products, and the diversion of management's focus from other business concerns. Moreover, past and future acquisitions may lead to substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. A significant portion of IDEX's total assets includes intangible assets, primarily goodwill resulting from acquisitions.\nCompetitive Market Risk: IDEX Corporation holds a strong market share in most of its North American businesses, but faces intense competition that can impact sales and operating margins. Maintaining this position requires continuous investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service, and distribution networks. Competitors in the Fluid & Metering Technologies segment include Dover Corporation and Ingersoll Rand; in Health & Science Technologies, competitors are Parker Hannifin and Jenoptik; and in Fire & Safety/Diversified Products, key competitors are Waterous Company and Holmatro, Inc. Failure to compete effectively could negatively impact IDEX's financial performance.\nRaw Material and Supply Risk: IDEX Corporation requires substantial amounts of raw materials and components from suppliers to meet customer needs. Any changes in the supply and price of these raw materials or components due to supply chain crises could materially affect the company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. Disruptions caused by global tensions, natural disasters, or logistical challenges can lead to shortages or increased costs, directly impacting IDEX's ability to maintain production and meet customer demands.\n",

Economic cycles, higher interest rates, inflation, increased labor costs, trade barriers, and other industry-specific economic factors may negatively impact demand for LECO’s products. A decrease in demand would affect the company’s cash flow and, consequently, its financial condition. Slowing industrial activity and the recovery period for the welding sector could hurt business prospects. Continuous monitoring of the US ISM Index for signs of industrial recovery is critical. Additionally, concerns about weak macroeconomic data from Europe and large heavy machinery original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) could also affect LECO’s production schedules.\nRaw Material and Energy Price Risk: LECO faces market risks such as the availability and price of energy and commodities used in its products. Factors affecting the availability and price of raw materials include worldwide economic conditions, supply and demand balances, inventory levels, currency exchange rates, competitor production costs, and expected shortages. Steel and Copper, in particular, is prone to price volatility and shortages. If the company cannot raise its prices to customers to offset the increased cost of raw materials, profit is negatively affected. Disruptions in the supply chain, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, can make it difficult for LECO to obtain the materials they need to manufacture their products and leading to production delays and shortages.\nAcquisition Risk: LECO Corporation's growth strategy relies heavily on strategic acquisitions, which come with significant risks. High integration costs and efforts can hurt business performance, causing integration issues, management distraction, and undisclosed liabilities. Acquisitions involve difficulties in assimilating operations, technologies, services, and products, and divert management's focus from other concerns. Recent examples include the Fori Automation acquisition in December 2022. While this acquisition expands LECO's automation portfolio, integration costs could strain profitability. Additionally, maintaining their reputation for high-quality products can be jeopardized if acquired entities don't meet their standards, potentially straining resources and impacting market position and financial stability.\nInternational political and economic risks: As LECO manufactures, distributes and sells its products globally, the company is increasingly exposed to various risks outside the U.S. Growing international sales heighten these risks, particularly in developing countries where political and economic uncertainty can hinder growth. Compliance with foreign laws is essential; failure to do so can result in liabilities and reputational damage. Additionally, environmental regulations and climate-related challenges pose significant concerns, while geopolitical risks like trade tensions and regional conflicts can disrupt supply chains. These factors are crucial for LECO’s continued global expansion in the welding, cutting, and joining products market.\nTrade Secret Risk: LECO relies on patent, copyright, and trade secret laws in the U.S. and abroad, as well as agreements with employees, customers, and other third parties to establish and protect its intellectual property rights. Revenues can be negatively affected if these property rights are not enforced or if third parties claim that LECO has violated their intellectual property rights.\n",

In addition, higher interest rates make alternative income-focused investments more attractive. This could lead to capital rotation away from the industry as investors chase yield elsewhere.\nIncreasing cost of capital – There are many sources of increasing cost of capital in the energy infrastructure industry including rising interest rates, rising equity yields and increasing incentive distribution rights (IDRs), among others. In a capital intensive industry, rising capital cost reduces accretion from organic growth projects and acquisitions, putting growth plans at risk.\nCapital markets access – Energy infrastructure companies require capital to grow and capital markets are notoriously fickle. If a company needs to raise capital at a time when the capital markets are effectively closed, this can derail a company’s business plan or at the least delay its execution significantly.\nEquity price is a primary model input – Some MLP business models are based on being able to issue equity at a certain cost (or range of costs). If equity markets are depressed for a prolonged period, this may also require management to slam the brakes on the business plan.\nHigh correlation to crude oil prices – Regardless of whether this makes sense or not (we believe it does not), the reality is that energy infrastructure equity prices are highly correlated to crude oil prices. We are not sure when or if this relationship will de-couple, and believe it unwise to assume it will. In the meantime, we will have to tolerate this correlation.\nChange in the tax code – The majority of the companies in the energy infrastructure industry are structured as Master Limited Partnerships. These companies are vulnerable to changes in the tax code related to pass-through income. The remainder of the companies, which are structured as traditional C Corporations, are vulnerable to changes in corporate taxation.\nM&A activity – Commonly thought of as a positive stock driver, it is not so cut and dried in the energy infrastructure industry. If the sponsor of a sponsored MLP is acquired, focus may shift away from the sponsored MLP of the target. Perhaps the acquirer already sponsors its own MLP and will divert growth away from the MLP of the sponsor being acquired. This is a very company-specific risk but is not uncommon.\n",

        "Risks": "Municipal water and wastewater M&A has become challenging, especially in PA: WTRG's growth on the water side relies on privatizations of water and wastewater systems currently owned by municipalities. The muni M&A has become challenging due to competition and opposition from ratepayers who fear sharply higher water bills. Our '24-'25 EPS estimates for WTRG reflect the pending acquisition of the DELCORA wastewater system in PA though the transaction has been tied up in courts for years now.\nLower sales volumes could weigh on WTRG’s realized ROEs and thus earnings: A utility can see a meaningful deficiency between its realized and allowed ROE depending on the level of sales volumes and operating expenses. While the latter can be controlled, sharp reductions in sales volumes due to energy efficiency (residential and commercial sales) or closure of industrial facilities. The latter is particularly pronounced during the COVID pandemic. The sharply lower C&I sales volumes could weigh on utility earnings beyond 2020. While rate cases could true up sales volume assumptions, utilities could delay rate filings because their ROE could be reduced during those proceedings on the back of sharply lower interest rates.\nRate case outcomes are hard to predict: While regulated utilities are allowed to recover prudently incurred costs, it's up to state utility regulators to determine which costs are in fact recoverable and the return on regulated assets. Some rate case requesting higher revenues may end with a reduction in authorized rates thus revenues and thus earnings. WTRG's regulatory calendar is quiet in 2020, with a pending small rate case in NC, and a likely filing for a catch-up repair tax adjustment for Peoples in PA.\nGas utilities have a higher operating risk than water utilities: Over-pressurized gas systems seem to happen more frequently among gas utilities in the US. While we recognize that Peoples Gas is a well-managed system, WTRG's risk profile could further deteriorate with any gas-related operational issues. Additionally, investors increasingly scrutinize the carbon footprint of gas LDCs which in turn weighs on their market valuations.\n",

        "Risks": "Prices: The primary risk for NUE is steel price movements relative to input costs (often referred to as metal spreads in the industry) that are the predominant governing factor of earnings overshadowing demand trends that we view as a secondary driver. During pricing upcycles the company tends to benefit from inventory outsized spreads that result in above normal margins and returns. Conversely, during a deflationary environment margins tend to compress below the through cycle average.\nSupply-Demand: Steel and companies are highly cyclical with often outsized moves relative to the broader economy. Changes in demand because of cyclical trends and from key end markets such as construction, auto-transports, and general manufacturing are all notable risks. Changes in policy, including infrastructure spending levels as well as incentives (or lack thereof) for re-shoring manufacturing, are both notable risks and potential opportunities.\nSecular Trends: Long-term secular shifts in steel consumption can pose both risk and opportunity. Improving yield loss over recent decades and greater indirect, downstream, steel trade are both notable long-term risks for the company and sector. Additionally, as an economy enters its developed stage following growth, there tends to be a lower need for steel and metals on a per capita basis. All these factors have weighed on steel consumption over the long term and will continue to in the coming decades.\nTrade: Trade policy, changes, or introductions of tariffs is also a risk. Changes in trade policy can have a significant impact on steel pricing given global trade flows. The US, as well as other countries, have been particularly aggressive on the trade policy front for decades, aiming to protect the domestic industry from overcapacity issues in other regions and/or dumped products. Changes to policy, in particular, a reduction or removal of prior tariffs implemented can pose risk for the company.\nCapacity: Upstream steel and metals capacity, specifically overcapacity, both domestically and globally are risks for steel producers as it influences pricing. Over the past 20 plus years' overcapacity in China for steel and metals has been a significant headwind for the global market, tempering more robust pricing fundamentals. In the future developing markets in other areas of the world pose a risk of overcapacity.\nFinancial: Equity investing presents its own sets of risks given the potential for shares to reach zero under extreme circumstances. The steel and metals sector exhibits outsized volatility largely driven by product price movements and the highly cyclical nature of the businesses. Based on the health of credit markets, refinancing existing debt and revolvers may pose risk as well, in extreme cases lacking availability of lenders, or unfavorable rates.\n",

        "Risks": "Macro slowdown/deterioration. Although the auto retailers' revenue tends to be less cyclical than their OEM and supplier peers due to the somewhat counter-cyclical nature of their Service & Parts businesses (the greatest contributor to their gross profit) and their more flexible cost structures, they are still susceptible to economic volatility.\nAccelerating shift to EVs. Despite claims to the contrary by some, we believe that the shift to EV could prove detrimental to the auto retailers' Service & Parts business. In fact, highly regarded Consumer Reports recently published the results of a study which showed that lifetime maintenance and repair costs for EVs and PHEVs were 50% lower than those for ICE vehicles ($4,600 vs. $9,200):\n\n\nThis could impact the dealers as the Service & Parts business 1) is typically the most recession-resistant of all their businesses and 2) comprises the greatest proportion of gross profit. Thus, a decline in Service & Parts revenue could both diminish the overall profitability of these companies, as well as make them more cyclical. That said, there are mitigating factors such as 1) the continued significant increase in vehicle complexity with increased electronic content and electrification, could enable the dealers to capture an increasing proportion of total Service and Parts revenue, and 2) with EV penetration in the US and globally now in just the low single digit range, the path to significant EV penetration is likely to be a fairly long one, giving this group many years to adjust and adapt. Note that increased vehicle complexity has helped drive mid-single digit revenue growth for nearly all the dealers for the past several years\nSlowing of/an inhospitable M&A environment. Given their significant free cash flow generation, one of the reliable avenues for growth for Auto Retailers has been M&A. For example:\nThus, to the extent that the M&A environment becomes less friendly, either via fewer/less willing sellers, higher prices, or both – this could unfavorably impact growth plans. That said, while interest in selling amongst smaller operators was robust even pre-pandemic as many of them faced generational succession issues, interest has reportedly spiked higher post-pandemic as many small operators have found it difficult to compete with larger dealer groups as their resources, online capabilities, etc. pale in comparison -- very similar to the dynamics in the dining and broader retail sectors where the largest entities are thriving while smaller ones are suffering.\n",

On a direct basis, SoFi has historically used securitizations as one of its funding vehicles for its personal and student loans. On an indirect basis, some of its third-party loan purchasers use the securitization markets to permanently fund loan purchases. Rapid changes in interest rates and credit spreads can impact demand for and interest rates paid to investors on securitizations which can impact the loan premiums and gain-on-sale revenues recognized on loans that are sold and/or securitized by SoFi.\nCompetition – Competition in the consumer lending business remains intense, particularly in the unsecured loan markets where there are more limited barriers to entry and fintechs have increased their presence. There is also significant competition in the various product offerings in the Financial Services segment.\nConcentration Risk – SoFi sells a significant percentage of its personal loans, student loans and home loans to a concentrated number of whole loan purchasers. The top five whole loan purchasers by total unpaid principal balance of loans sold accounted for approximately 67% of the aggregate principal balance of its loans sold during the year ended December 31, 2021. Galileo’s customers are highly concentrated, with its five largest customers contributing approximately 70% of the total net revenue within the Technology Platform segment during the three months ended March 31, 2021. The Technisys acquisition closed in March 2022 has helped lower concentration risk in the Technology Platform.\nCredit Risk – Although the credit card portfolio is SoFi’s smallest lending product at present, it is growing very rapidly and has shown signs of credit deterioration in recent periods. There is also credit risk associated with the personal and student loan portfolios, although such risk is mitigated through the higher credit spectrums served with these products as well as a relatively short holding period for the loans.\nGAAP Profitability – At present, we do not expect SoFi to become profitable on a GAAP basis until 2025 at the earliest. With two of the three segments largely valued by investors based on GAAP profitability, stock price performance could be inhibited and/or face greater regulatory oversight.\nImpact of Hedging Activities – SoFi’s hedging activities have been a significant contributor to profits since the beginning of the year. Yet disclosures on such activities are very limited, there is no transparency around the hedging strategy, and the hedge gains have boosted GOS margins above historic levels.\nPayment for Order Flow – Payment for order flow has come under greater regulatory scrutiny. SoFi does not disclose such revenues which are included in the “brokerage” revenue line item under its Financial Services segment. While we do not believe such revenues are material, curtailment in PFOF could have some impact on segment revenues and/or when the segment is expected to become profitable on a GAAP basis.\nRegulation – Consumer lending has come under greater regulatory scrutiny, particularly by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Regulatory changes for consumer lenders could have many implications including reduced profitability, demand for products, and/or fines and penalties.\n",

Industry analysts see a $42/Bbl average breakeven price in the DB. COP says its breakeven is ~$35/Bbl. Current futures prices do not suggest this is a meaningful risk, but past behavior suggests E&Ps will not hesitate to reduce activity if returns become unattractive.\nLonger-Term Risk Relates to SWD permitting due to seismicity. There are areas in both the Midland and Delaware Basins that regulators have declared off-limits to future production water disposal due to the seismic activity that SWD wells induce. One way to reduce seismicity is to inject less total water into the SWD at lower injection pressure. This ultimately requires more SWDs to sequester the same amount of water. If available locations to dispose of production water are reduced concurrently, produced water disposal becomes more difficult to accomplish.\nAs the scenario above evolves ARIS could charge higher fees for disposal, but this would likely be offset by greater disposal expense as available disposal sites become more valuable. Longer-term, a growing paucity of disposal locations could inhibit new well drilling, producing the same negative effects for ARIS as low oil prices.\nBeneficial Water Reuse Effort Fails Commerciality. While this is not a risk during our forecast period, we see success in beneficial reuse as the necessary hedge against reduced SWD locations in the future.

The LOCE (levelized cost of electricity) is the NPV (net present value) of the unit-cost of electricity over the lifetime of a power generation system. The formula’s output represents the average revenue-per-unit of electricity (i.e. MWh) that a given type of power plant would have to earn in order to recover the sum of its capex and lifetime operating costs, usually assuming a plant service span of 20-to-40 years. Many positive outlooks for onshore turbine growth are heavily predicated on LCOE trends and analytics, which suggest that unsubsidized onshore wind has become increasingly competitive with conventional power sources, such as coal-fired and CCTG plants. Among other flaws, the LCOE oversimplifies costs; oversimplifies or simply misses project context; ignores flexibility considerations, such as whether backup thermal power or stationary storage are needed; and masks regional variability when applied to projects in different countries, according to Sakhi Shah (Energy for Growth Hub) and Morgan Bazilian (Payne Institute). The formula is also highly-sensitive to the capacity factor assumption.\nThe global clean H2 complex continues to improve the technology and structurally reduce the costs of electrolysis, which could catalyze an unexpected acceleration in consumption and/or result in applications that open new end markets.\nBetween now and 2027, PLUG could benefit from lower-than-expected prices for the external hydrogen it procures for delivery to customers.\nPLUG has various cost out initiatives that could result in greater savings than we’re assuming.\nPLUG could realize a higher win rate and/or pricing on the more than 1GW of electrolyzer orders it’s pursuing in 2025.\nPLUG could realize a higher win rate and/or pricing on its liquid H2 and non-liquid H2 sales funnels of $424MM and $190MM, respectively, than we’re assuming.\nPLUG’s target business model aims for far better outcomes than we’re currently modeling through 2027, including over 30% average revenue growth, a 35%+ gross margin, ~13% operating leverage, and a 22%+ EBIT margin.\nIt's possible that PLUG could receive and accept a takeover offer for total consideration that places a value on its equity above our target price.\n",

        "Risks": "Any potential recessionary impact on consumer spending, media partner demand and pricing/economics. With Starz marketing as a complementary/add-on streaming service, if consumers feel a need to pull back on discretionary spending, a Starz subscription could be at risk (even though its cost represents only ~$0.35/day for entertainment). Other Media companies that might partner with Starz, and who might have advertising businesses themselves, may face ad revenue challenges in a recession that could drive them to renegotiate their economics with Starz.\nContinued cord-cutting pressures on retaining subscribers and their fees that support new content creation. Starz was one of the last OTT streaming services to raise prices last year, and saw a modest and temporary decline in subscribers as a result. With revenues almost solely reliant on those subscriber fees to pay for existing and new content, any issues with subscriber trajectories and/or pricing that they accept or not, could impact the quality, volume and timing of new content that could in turn impact the ability to attract and retain subscribers in the future.\nIncreasing competition for sourcing original and library content, which could drive up costs and reduce the offerings for subscribers. With numerous subscription VOD, advertising VOD, and FAST (free ad-supported television) competitors vying to attract and retain subscribers with their content offerings, competition to acquire and access new and library content remains elevated, and could increase. This could further drive up costs to the streamer and could decrease the amount of content available for its subscribers, which could lead to the loss of any content-driven subscriber retention, and reduce margins and profitability.\nThe risk that third-party content licensors choose to withhold their library content for their own services. Starz sources pay-1 theatrical releases and older content from companies that generally have their own streaming services (Universal is a content partner, but is part of Comcast which owns Peacock; Disney has Disney+ and Hulu; but Sony is one without its own streamer in the US), which could risk a renewal upon expiration of the current contracts, which would detract from the content offering and value proposition for subscribers if not renewed.\nChanges in economic relationships with distribution partners that could pressure net revenues and costs. Distributors include those in the linear network environment such as cable operators that might have their own DTC streaming services, so there could be conflicts of interest in the pricing and revenue-share economics they would be willing to agree to upon expiration. Similarly, Amazon Channels could exert market share power and pricing and instead promote its Amazon Prime video service over that of Starz.\nProgramming that misses the mark on consumer taste and demand. With Starz’ reliance on just a couple of targeted market segments, the small degree of new originals programmed each year risks the content offerings not resonating and subscribers possibly dropping their subscription.\nCompetition for video consumers’ time and the ability to monetize that usage via subscriptions. Starz’ streaming service does not even have the 0.8% share of US video usage time as estimated/disclosed monthly by Nielsen, possibly indicating that other services have been more effective in competing for consumers’ time and spending.\nThe current absence of an additional revenue stream in the form of advanced advertising. Starz prides itself on being and ad-free service, but the absence of such a revenue stream, while susceptible to economic volatility, means that Starz is possibly missing out on creating more marketing opportunities and brand recognition that also could drive subscriber growth, content creation, and profitability.\nStock liquidity risks associated with Starz being a newly-standalone company with a small market capitalization. Starz’ small market capitalization post-separation indicates that investors who wanted a larger entertainment entity wanted to, or were required to, divest their Starz holding. As such, there could be a volatile period of stock price action with the low share count and the time required for investors able to invest in small-cap companies to understand and get comfortable with the Starz business model.\n",

        "Risks": "M&A between JBT and Marel: While the proposed merger between JBT and Marel could create a strong player in the food and beverage technology sector, several risks are involved. Integrating JBT's food processing expertise with Marel's focus on protein processing requires careful planning to harmonize different engineering practices and potentially redundant product lines. Additionally, despite JBT's global presence, the sheer scale of this merger presents integration challenges. These challenges include cultural differences, harmonizing business systems, and potential operational redundancies. The success of the merger will ultimately hinge on both companies' ability to navigate these hurdles and effectively execute their integration plan.\nCyclicality risks: JBT isn't immune to the cyclical risks buffeting the food and beverage technology sector in this economic slowdown. Factors like rising interest rates, fuel costs, market volatility, inflation, government spending, labor costs, and other economic variables can negatively impact demand for JBT's products. Additionally, a softening residential market, construction delays, and a slowing European market (including inherited risks from Marel's European focus) all heighten JBT's exposure to cyclical downturns. Moreover, Weakness China have already impacted its international sales to a certain extent.\nRaw material and energy price risk: JBT faces significant market risks due to the current surge in energy and raw material prices. These can directly impact JBT's profitability, but also indirectly affect their customers in the midst of a broader economic slowdown. For instance, rising energy prices strain the transportation industry, squeezing the margins of passenger and cargo airlines already grappling with labor shortages and flight disruptions. Food processors are also under pressure, facing both higher energy costs to run facilities and logistics, and potential disruptions in the supply and pricing of raw materials like feed grains, livestock, and dairy products, all of which are further exacerbated by the ongoing war in Ukraine. These combined factors can considerably impact JBT's financial performance in the near future.\nInternational risks: JBT's global presence in the food and beverage technology sector exposes them to a multitude of risks. Political instability, regulatory shifts, and social unrest overseas can disrupt operations. Evolving food safety, environmental, and labor regulations can further complicate things. Intensified competition from local players and currency fluctuations can squeeze profits, while supply chain disruptions due to geopolitical events or trade wars can lead to delays and higher costs. By proactively managing these risks, JBT can navigate this complex global landscape and ensure continued success.\nSupply chain risks: JBT's reliance on external suppliers for raw materials, components, and finished goods introduces several inherent risks. Although last year's supply chain crisis has eased, lingering disruptions and a slowdown in demand continue to pose challenges. Difficulty in securing these materials cost-effectively or on time could disrupt JBT's manufacturing processes, leading to delays, inefficiencies, and potentially missed production targets. Additionally, if JBT cannot fully pass on rising raw material and component costs to customers due to softened demand, their profitability could be adversely affected. By fostering strong supplier relationships and exploring alternative sourcing options, JBT can mitigate these risks and better navigate the evolving supply chain landscape.\nFinancial and fixed price contract risks: JBT's recent acquisition of Marel expands their market reach but also introduces new financial considerations. The integration process requires careful management, as JBT's existing financing agreements contain covenants that, if breached, could trigger immediate repayment of outstanding loans. This, coupled with the current high-interest rate environment, could significantly strain JBT's cash flow. Further complicating the picture is Marel's already weak cash flow, which adds to the financial burden of the merger. JBT's reliance on fixed-price contracts, where they bear the cost of any overruns, adds another layer of risk.\n",

As more boutique advisory firms have gone public to pursue more aggressive growth strategies, there is greater competition for talent and deal flow within the strategic advisory and restructuring businesses. This can lead to higher compensation expenses or loss of talent, or both.\nMacroeconomic Risk. M&A and other strategic advisory activities are highly cyclical, with appetite for M&A among corporate buyers typically falling materially during recessions or other forms of economic and market stress. In turn, this can negatively impact strategic advisory fees.\nEarnings Volatility. There are no long-term recurring revenue streams in the advisory business, and thus revenue and earnings can be volatile around the timing of advisory assignments closing (when the majority of fees are collected). Coupled with significant cyclicality and sensitivity to other macro events, earnings volatility among boutique advisory firms is high. However, a sizable contribution from the countercyclical restructuring business (~25% of total revenue) help reduce MC's cross cycle volatility.\nRegulatory, legal, and Reputational Risk. We don't view regulatory or legal risk as particularly high in the advisory business, although there is always the risk of fraud on the part of corporate clients or advisory personnel, which can result in monetary penalties and reputational damage (which could result in client attrition).\nPricing Risk Modest. Given the episodic nature of M&A and its significant impact on the strategic outlook for a company, we have seen little-to-no degradation in advisory fees over the past 20 years.

Thus, a decline in Service & Parts revenue could both diminish the overall profitability of these companies, and make them more cyclical. That said, there are mitigating factors such as 1) the continued significant increase in vehicle complexity with increased electronic content and electrification, could enable the dealers to capture an increasing proportion of total Service and Parts revenue, and 2) with EV penetration in the US and globally now in just the low single digit range, the path to significant EV penetration is likely to be a long one, giving this group many years to adjust and adapt. Note that increased vehicle complexity has helped drive mid-single digit revenue growth for nearly all the dealers for the past several years and it is expected to continue.\nSlowing of/an inhospitable M&A environment. Given their significant free cash flow generation, one of the reliable avenues for growth for Auto Retailers has been M&A. For example Lithia has been a chronic and successful acquiror and plans to acquire an additional $20B in revenue over the next five years (in addition to other growth initiatives). Thus, to the extent that the M&A environment becomes less friendly, either via fewer/less willing sellers, higher prices, or both – this could unfavorably impact growth plans. That said, while interest in selling amongst smaller operators was robust even prepandemic as many of them faced generational succession issues, interest has reportedly spiked higher post-pandemic as many small operators have found it difficult to compete with larger dealer groups as their resources, online capabilities, etc. pale in comparison -- very similar to the dynamics in the dining and broader retail sectors where the largest entities are thriving while smaller ones face difficulty keeping pace.\nHigher U.S. tax rates. As these companies are very profitable, the auto retailers were large beneficiaries of the reduction in U.S tax rates a few years ago (for examples, PAG effective tax rate declined from 32.6% in 2017 to 24.3% in 2018). Thus, the potential for higher tax rates under a new administration could be punitive to the auto retailers given their significant profit bases and having few, if any, Deferred Tax Assets to mitigate the impact.\nStall in Finance & Insurance revenue growth. The continued unrelenting growth of F&I revenue (well beyond what many investors believed was possible) has essentially offset the secular compression in new and used vehicle margins such that “front-end yields” have remained relatively stable. However, ff vehicle margins continue to compress and F&I revenue growth stalls, both revenue and earnings for the group would be impacted unfavorably.\n",

        "Risks": "LCOE is an imperfect tool for comparing the unit costs of different power sources. The LOCE (levelized cost of electricity) is the NPV (net present value) of the unit-cost of electricity over the lifetime of a power generation system. The formula’s output represents the average revenue-per-unit of electricity (i.e. MWh) that a given type of power plant would have to earn in order to recover the sum of its capex and lifetime operating costs, usually assuming a plant service span of 20-to-40 years. Many positive outlooks for onshore turbine growth are heavily predicated on LCOE trends and analytics, which suggest that unsubsidized onshore wind has become increasingly competitive with conventional power sources, such as coal-fired and CCTG plants. Among other flaws, the LCOE oversimplifies costs; oversimplifies or simply misses project context; ignores flexibility considerations, such as whether backup thermal power or stationary storage are needed; and masks regional variability when applied to projects in different countries, according to Sakhi Shah (Energy for Growth Hub) and Morgan Bazilian (Payne Institute). The formula is also highly-sensitive to the capacity factor assumption.\nDemand for ARRY’s offerings is a straight function of utility-scale solar development. ARRY’s customer base – EPCs, developers, IPPs, and utilities – order its products based on assumptions about the economic viability and consumption trajectory for solar energy. If investment in large-scale solar plants and parks should cease growing, then the company’s sales could stagnate or trend down. As it has historically, the level of solar plant and park spending should continue to be determined by a variety of macro factors, such as global through regional GDP growth rates, electricity usage trends, the relative economics of rival power generation sources, government policies and regulations, available financing options, and the supply and cost of labor, raw materials, and components. One clear risk in this monetary tightening episode and the new, higher interest rate paradigm many expect it to lead to is a reduction in the availability of tax equity or project debt financing. Another is the threat posed to the hurdle rates of certain investors, such as infrastructure and pension funds, by the need to use steeper discount rates for solar energy projects.\nSolar competes with other fuel sources within the power mix. A new solar plant scheme often confronts rival proposals centered on other electricity generation sources, such as a coal-fired, CCGT (combined cycle gas turbine), nuclear, or wind facility. Solar competes with these alternatives mainly on the basis of price dynamics and predictability, the availability and dispatchability of the fuel source, the ease with which the output can be used, and logistical considerations.\nGovernment curtailment of incentives and/or mandates could hurt solar project spending. ARRY sells most of its tracker systems for grid-connected applications, wherein the produced solar electricity is sold into an organized wholesale market or under a PPA (power purchase agreement). This grid-connected segment of the solar industry has historically relied in large part on the availability and size of government policies that promote renewables. Such policies take the form of tax credits, rebates, mandates, and/or financial “carrots and sticks” to incentivize the development of solar energy infrastructure by owners, end users, distributors, and equipment providers.\nFinancial results can be impacted by seasonality. Solar farm construction activity generally declines in the Northern Hemisphere from late autumn through winter, largely because setting foundations is more expensive when the ground is frozen. Consequently, ARRY’s revenue for the first and last quarters of a typical year will be lower than its top line for the middle two quarters.\nARRY’s competitiveness is reliant on its ability to defend vital proprietary knowledge. The company depends on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, and confidentiality agreements to protect its intellectual property. As of 12/31/24, ARRY had 326 issued patents (56 U.S. and 273 non-U.S.) and 158 pending patents. The U.S. issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2030 and 2042. Globally, the company has 125 registered trademarks and 97 pending trademark applications.\nThe company has a meaningful degree of financial leverage. ARRY exited 1Q 2025 with total debt of $693MM, net debt of $345MM, and a net debt-to-total capital ratio of 33%. The company’s future debt maturities sum to $268MM for 2023 through 2027, and to $425MM for 2028 and thereafter.\nAcute trade tensions, especially between the U.S. and China, could result in harmful tariffs. Simmering trade conflicts can lead to the imposition of or increases in tariffs, duties, and import restrictions. Flare-ups between the U.S. and China have already resulted in tariffs on both tracker inputs, such as steel, and on other vital solar farm components, such as modules and PV cells. The solar industry faces ongoing uncertainty about the punitive and retaliatory risks posed by the tense Sino-U.S. trade relationship. Whether directly via a tracker input (e.g. steel) and/or indirectly through another solar farm component (e.g. solar panels), such measures could adversely affect ARRY’s business. Among other negative impacts, ARRY could experience a contraction in overall customer demand, project timeline delays, and/or a deterioration in its profit margins.\n",

        "Risks": "Prices: The primary risk for CLF is steel price movements relative to input costs (often referred to as metal spreads in the industry) that are the predominant governing factor of earnings overshadowing demand trends that we view as a secondary driver. During pricing upcycles the company tends to benefit from inventory outsized spreads that result in above normal margins and returns. Conversely, during deflationary environment margins tend to compress below the through cycle average.\nSupply-Demand: Steel and companies are highly cyclical with often outsized moves relative to the broader economy. Changes in demand because of cyclical trends and from key end markets such as construction, auto-transports, and general manufacturing are all notable risks. Changes in policy, including infrastructure spending levels as well as incentives (or lack thereof) for re-shoring manufacturing, are both notable risks and potential opportunities.\nSecular Trends: Long-term secular shifts in steel consumption can pose both risk and opportunity. Improving yield loss over recent decades and greater indirect, downstream, steel trade are both notable long-term risks for the company and sector. Additionally, as an economy enters its developed stage following growth, there tends to be a lower need for steel and metals on a per capita basis. All thesefactors have weighed on steel consumption over the long term and will continue to in the coming decades.\nTrade: Trade policy, changes, or introductions of tariffs is also a risk. Changes in trade policy can have a significant impact on steel pricing given global trade flows. The US, as well as other countries, have been particularly aggressive on the trade policy front for decades, aiming to protect the domestic industry from overcapacity issues in other regions and/or dumped products. Changes to policy, in particular, a reduction or removal of prior tariffs implemented can pose risk for the company.\nCapacity: Upstream steel and metals capacity, specifically overcapacity, both domestically and globally are risks for steel producers as it influences pricing. Over the past 20 plus years' overcapacity in China for steel and metals has been a significant headwind for the global market, tempering more robust pricing fundamentals. In the future developing markets in other areas of the world pose a risk of overcapacity.\nFinancial: Equity investing presents its own sets of risks, given the potential for shares to reach zero under extreme circumstances. The steel and metals sector exhibits outsized volatility largely driven by product price movements and the highly cyclical nature of the businesses. Based on the health of credit markets, refinancing existing debt and revolvers may pose risk as well, in extreme cases lacking availability of lenders, or unfavorable rates.\n",

        "Risks": "Acquisition risk: RRX frequently undertakes the acquisition of large enterprises, integrating them into its established business framework. This strategy, while potentially beneficial, introduces several operational risks. The recent acquisition of Altra Industrial Motion Corp., along with previous purchases such as Rexnord's Process & Motion Control segment, highlights these challenges. The process of merging disparate corporate cultures, systems, and operational procedures can be complex and costly, often resulting in higher-than-anticipated integration expenses and potential business disruptions. Moreover, acquiring new companies can expose RRX to future earnings risks due to market unpredictability, competitive forces, and unforeseen liabilities\nDebt and Financial Flexibility: A major risk Regal Rexnord Corporation (RRX) faces is the substantial debt incurred from the $4.95 billion all-cash acquisition of Altra Industrial Motion Corp. This significant debt burden could compromise Regal Rexnord's financial agility and its capacity to achieve debt reduction goals. Additionally, the debt associated with large acquisitions escalates fixed expenses, further constraining future financial flexibility. It is crucial for the company to generate ample cash flow throughout 2024 to manage, service, and reduce the leverage effectively.\nCompetitive global motor markets. Regal operates in a highly competitive global electric motor industry. Following the acquisition of Altra Industrial Motion Corp., RRX must effectively compete in the industrial and automation markets. The company's extensive customer base exposes it to a wide range of domestic and international competitors. Success in these markets will depend on leveraging synergies from the acquisition, enhancing product offerings, and maintaining technological leadership to meet diverse customer needs and outperform rivals. Moving forward, we believe the industry could face increased competition from international regions such as China.\nRaw Material Price Risk: Like many firms in the industrial manufacturing sector, is susceptible to fluctuations in metal prices, which can negatively impact its operations. The company's products depend on raw materials such as steel, copper, aluminum, and rare earth metals, all prone to substantial price swings. While RRX attempts to mitigate these costs by raising selling prices instead of imposing surcharges, this approach may not always succeed, leading to margin compression. Recent decreases in raw material costs could boost RRX's gross margin, but potential future price hikes remain a concern.\nLarge HVAC customer concentration risk. RRX has several main customers; a loss or cancellation in orders from a main customer can have a large impact on RRX's financial results. The company sells into the overall HVAC motor business, which is in a sense a main customer; it is essential that RBC maintains and develops its relationship with the large HVAC equipment makers. The company cannot be assured that its customers won’t switch to another competitor. The result of one main customer switching business to a competitor can have a major impact on the financial condition of the company.\nSeasonal Demand Fluctuations: RRX depends heavily on sales of HVAC systems, which are highly seasonal and weather dependent. During peak summer months, demand for HVAC systems soars as consumers seek relief from the heat. Conversely, winter months witness a significant decline in sales as the need for cooling diminishes. An unusually cold or mild summer could significantly impact RRX's sales and profitability. This is because a large portion of their revenue comes from seasonal product lines directly tied to weather patterns.\nProduct Innovation Risk: RRX is committed to product innovation that enhances line speeds, safety, and energy efficiency. However, reliance on innovation carries risks, including the potential for technological advancements to fall short of market expectations or competitors' offerings. Additionally, staying ahead in secular end markets such as food, beverage, and intralogistics requires continuous investment in R&D. Failure to innovate or misalignment with market needs can erode brand trust and loyalty. Cross-functional collaboration across IPS, PES, and AMC segments is crucial, but coordination challenges may hinder the delivery of differentiated solutions.\n",

Either of these can result in large financial penalties and damage STT’s reputation (which could result in client attrition).\nCompetitive Risk. STT provides asset servicing to some of the largest asset managers in the world, and thus has concentration risk among its client base. Consequently, the loss to a competitor of a large client could have a material impact on forward earnings, as we saw with BlackRock.\n",

As more boutique advisory firms have gone public to pursue more aggressive growth strategies, there is greater competition for talent and deal flow within the strategic advisory and restructuring businesses. This can lead to higher compensation expenses or loss of talent, or both.\nMacroeconomic Risk. M&A and other strategic advisory activities are highly cyclical, with appetite for M&A among corporate buyers typically falling materially during recessions or other forms of economic and market stress. In turn, this can negatively impact strategic advisory fees.\nEarnings Volatility. There are no long-term recurring revenue streams in the advisory business, and thus revenue and earnings can be volatile around the timing of advisory assignments closing (when the majority of fees are collected). Coupled with significant cyclicality and sensitivity to other macro events, earnings volatility among boutique advisory firms is high. However, increasing diversification by EVR into other, more countercyclical revenue streams such as restructuring, capital markets advisory, and ECM are reducing its cross cycle volatility.\nRegulatory, legal, and Reputational Risk. We don't view regulatory or legal risk as particularly high in the advisory business, although there is always the risk of fraud on the part of corporate clients or advisory personnel, which can result in monetary penalties and reputational damage (which could result in client attrition).\nPricing Risk Modest. Given the episodic nature of M&A and its significant impact on the strategic outlook for a company, we have seen little-to-no degradation in advisory fees over the past 20 years.

        "Risks": "Risks\nCustomer Acquisition and Customer Retention. If the company can not economically acquire new customers, its growth and profits could be impacted. Historically HIMS has had a payback period of less than a year on its marketing efforts. Additionally, if churn increases more than expected or customer retention is lower, results would likely be impacted as well. We note the move towards more personalized solutions should help improve customer retention rates going forward.\n\nHealthcare Advertising Regulations. HIMS relies on numerous marketing channels to acquire users. State and federal laws and regulations governing the privacy and security of personal information, including healthcare data, are evolving and could impact its ability to identify and market to potential and existing customers. If federal, state, or local laws governing marketing activities become more restrictive, results could be impacted.\n\nAdoption of Telehealth Platforms by Consumers and Providers. While we expect continued adoption of telehealth platforms, there are several risks to adoption including: privacy, customer data, regulatory development (e.g. ability to offer online prescriptions).\n\nCompetition. The market for online healthcare is becoming increasingly competitive. HIMS competes with both traditional healthcare providers as well as online providers (e.g. Amazon, Ro, Keep, etc). We believe HIMS is well positioned today given its breadth of offerings as well as strong brand, though we expect competition to continue to increase.\n\nProvider Access. HIMS success is based on its ability to maintain access to a network of Providers, including medical doctors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and licensed behavioral health providers. If the Affiliated Medical Groups are unable to recruit and retain licensed physicians and other qualified Providers to perform services on its platform, it could have a meaningful impact on its business. Additionally, higher payments to providers could also result in higher pricing for consumers which could impact consumer demand.\n\nInternational Expansion. We expect HIMS to expand more internationally over the long-term. International expansion has additional risks including business, geopolitical, regulatory, FX risks, etc.\n\nDisruption to Pharmacies. HIMS relies on Partner Pharmacies and Affiliated Pharmacies to provide efficient fulfillment and distribution of prescription medication. Interruption in the availability of a sufficient number of Providers or supply from these pharmacies could negatively impact its results.\n\nAffiliated Pharmacy Risks. A majority of the fulfillment and distribution of products available through its platform is done by its Affiliated Pharmacies. While HIMS does not directly own the Affiliated Pharmacies due to state-based regulatory considerations, disruptions to its Affiliated Pharmacies could materially impact its results. Additionally, the suspension or other limitation of any license held by an Affiliated Pharmacy or any failure by its Affiliated Pharmacies to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on its business and expose HIMS to civil and criminal penalties.\n\nTelehealth Laws and Regulations. Some states’ regulatory agencies could limit or restrict Providers’ ability to provide telehealth services. Additionally, there may be limitations placed on the modality through which telehealth services are delivered (e.g. synchronous vs asynchronous telehealth services). Additionally, regulatory agencies could restrict the manner in which prescription medications, including compounded products, can be marketed, dispensed, and sold. Compliance with these evolving laws, regulations, and interpretations may require HIMS to change its practices and increase the costs of doing business.\n\nChanges in insurance and healthcare laws. HIMS currently only accepts payments direct from customers, not from third parties or insurance providers. If HIMS is required to comply with the Health Care Reform Law and unable to manage risks and uncertainties, its financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nFDA Regulations. Certain of the products available through its platform require approval by the FDA and are subject to the limitations placed by the FDA on the approved uses in the product prescribing information. Some of these products are prescribed by Providers on the platform for “off-label” uses. If the FDA determines that its product promotion constitutes promotion of an unapproved use, the FDA could request that its modify its product promotion or subject them to regulatory and/or legal enforcement actions. Additionally, while the company believes the compounded drug products available through its platform meet the requirements for exemption under Section 503A of the FDCA, if the FDA were to determine that such products do not meet the requirements for exemption, the FDA could subject them to regulatory and/or legal enforcement actions.\n",

        "Risks": "Early Stage Company with History of Losses. Serve Robotics remains an early stage company with a history of losses and losses are expected to continue for foreseeable future until it can scale its operations. Additionally, Serve has limited experience commercializing its products at a large scale and may not be able to do so effectively. Key drivers of its growth include its ability to scale its sales, marketing, training, customer service and maintenance and servicing operations. The company’s auditor also issued a “going concern” opinion, indicating that without additional financing, it may not be able to succeed. Serve has noted that it will require significant capital to operate its business and fund our capital expenditures for the next several years. To that point, future capital needs may require them to sell additional equity or debt securities that may dilute stockholders or contain terms unfavorable to them and investors. Inability to raise sufficient funds could force them to curtail or discontinue its operations.\n\nMarket for Delivery Robots Remains Unproven. The market demand for and adoption of delivery robots is unproven. Further, Serve has no binding commitments to purchase products and services and there are no assurances that such robotic systems will provide their expected benefit to customers or compete with current delivery methods (e.g. human based delivery). Hence, if demand does not develop as expected or if Serve cannot accurately forecast pricing, adoption rates and sales cycle for its products, its results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\n\nRevenue Concentration. Serve Robotics has meaningful customer concentration today with Uber as its key customer. Serve noted that during the three months ended March 31, 2024, one customer accounted for 90% of the Company’s revenue. While Uber is a key player in the global food delivery market, we would like to see Serve further expand to other key food delivery platforms (e.g. DoorDash) in order to diversify its revenues.\n\nDisruption in Supply Chain for Robots. Serve is highly reliant on third party manufacturing for its robots. If its supply chain fails to deliver products in sufficient quality and quantity on a timely basis, Serve has noted it will be challenged to meet its target production and development timelines expected financial results and profitability. In 2022 and 2023, Serve experienced delays in supply chain deliveries, extended lead times and shortages of key components.\n\nShorter Useful Lives than Expected. While Serve is designing its products and technologies for a certain lifespan, there can be no assurance as to the actual operational life of a product. If its equipment and technology have shorter useful lives than anticipated, this could increase its costs and financial condition.\n\nPartnerships with 3P Delivery Platforms and Merchants. If Serve can not sufficiently maximize utilization of its robots, financial results will suffer. To this point, Serve relies heavily on 3P delivery platforms to drive orders (primarily Uber today). Potential impacts to utilization include insufficient merchant participation, platform partner matching algorithms, failure to deliver a commercial grade product, and a lack of product acceptance by merchants and/or delivery recipients. To date, Serve has noted that it has been able to continually increase its robot utilization in its partnership with Uber through improvement in its integration, high merchant participation, and product acceptance by users of the Uber platform. That said, market adoption of Serve remains early and there is no guarantee that utilization increases will meet its targets.\n\nBranding Revenues. Part of Serves long-term revenue goals are based on generating revenues from brand sponsors would pay to place their branding on its robots as a form of out-of-home (“OOH”) branding. To date, Serve has run periodic OOH advertising campaigns with several brands in varying sectors including real estate, fashion and entertainment. Should demand for advertising on Serve Robots not meet its goals, financial results could suffer.\n\nAbility to Provide Safe and Reliable Service. Should Serve’s robots have errors including errors caused by human supervisors, network connectivity issues, third-party software or automation, this could impact its commercial relationships. Since Serve operates on public sidewalks, it has to maintain high standards for public safety. For instance, robots yield the right of way to vehicles, pedestrians, and other sidewalk and road users. Partners, such as Uber, require timely reporting of any material safety incidents. If the robots are not able to operate safely, its commercial relationships may be jeopardized. That said, to date, Serve has not experienced material safety incidents nor has its partners raised any concerns about its safety standards and track record.\n\nRegulation for Personal Delivery Devices (PDDs). Sidewalk robots are not by default prohibited from operations in most jurisdictions. That said, there is no guarantee that the current permissive environment will not change in the future and changes in regulations or permit requirements could adversely impact its business. Serve notes that is proactively engages with lawmakers, academics, standards-setting organizations, urban planning nonprofits, disability rights advocates, senior citizen organizations and regional bicycle coalitions to anticipate and mitigate potential regulatory challenges. To date, over a dozen states across the United States have enacted legislation regulating PDDs. While these regulations have been largely industry-friendly, they have not been uniform. For instance, Washington State and the District of Columbia have a 100-pound unladen weight restriction and the City of Santa Monica prohibits the operation of autonomous devices on sidewalks.\n\nDefects in Robots. Defects, glitches or malfunctions in its products or the software that operates them, or operator errors may result in product recalls, lower than expected return on investment for customers and could cause safety concerns. These could all affect its results of operations. While Serve conducts extensive testing of its units, there can be no assurances that Serve can identify all potential defects in a timely manner. Such defects could result in the removal of its products from the market which could result in significant costs and delays in market acceptance.\n\nCompetition. Serve operates in a competitive industry with several players investing in PDDs or sidewalk robots as well as autonomous vehicles. Faster go to market or technology advancements by its competitors could lead to reduced competitiveness for Serve Robotics. Competitors may also have greater financial resources, enabling them to innovate and expand faster.\n\nIntellectual Property Rights. Serve notes that its success depends on its ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of its technology. However, some of its proprietary information may not be patentable, and others could utilize similar or superior solutions to compete with them. Results would also be adversely affected if third parties claim that its products infringed their patent, copyright or other intellectual property rights.\n\n",

        "Risks": "Macro slowdown/deterioration. Although the auto retailers' revenue tends to be less cyclical than their OEM and supplier peers due to the somewhat counter-cyclical nature of their Service & Parts businesses (the greatest contributor to their gross profit) and their more flexible cost structures, they are still susceptible to economic volatility.\nAccelerating shift to EVs. Despite claims to the contrary by some, we believe that the shift to EVs could prove detrimental to the auto retailers' Service & Parts business. In fact, highly regarded Consumer Reports recently published the results of a study which showed that lifetime maintenance and repair costs for EVs and PHEVs were 50% lower than those for ICE vehicles ($4,600 vs. $9,200):\n\n\nThis could impact the dealers as the Service & Parts business 1) is typically the most recession resistant of all their businesses and 2) comprises the greatest proportion of gross profit. Thus, a decline in Service & Parts revenue could both diminish the overall profitability of these companies, and make them more cyclical. That said, there are mitigating factors such as 1) the continued significant increase in vehicle complexity with increased electronic content and electrification, could enable the dealers to capture an increasing proportion of total Service and Parts revenue, and 2) with EV penetration in the US and globally now in just the low single digit range, the path to significant EV penetration is likely to be a long one, giving this group many years to adjust and adapt. Note that increased vehicle complexity has helped drive mid-single digit revenue growth for nearly all the dealers for the past several years and it is expected to continue.\nSlowing of/an inhospitable M&A environment. Given their significant free cash flow generation, one of the reliable avenues for growth for Auto Retailers has been M&A. For example, ABG recently closed on the acquisition of Park Place, its biggest in its history, growing its revenue base by nearly 25%. Thus, to the extent that the M&A environment becomes less friendly, either via fewer/less willing sellers, higher prices, or both – this could unfavorably impact growth plans. That said, while interest in selling amongst smaller operators was robust even pre-pandemic as many of them faced generational succession issues, interest has reportedly spiked higher post-pandemic as many small operators have found it difficult to compete with larger dealer groups as their resources, online capabilities, etc. pale in comparison -- very similar to the dynamics in the dining and broader retail sectors where the largest entities are thriving while smaller ones face difficulty keeping pace.\nHigher U.S. tax rates. As these companies are very profitable, the auto retailers were large beneficiaries of the reduction in U.S tax rates a few years ago. Thus, the potential for higher tax rates under a new administration could be punitive to the auto retailers given their significant profit bases and having few, if any, Deferred Tax Assets to mitigate the impact.\nStall in Finance & Insurance revenue growth. The continued unrelenting growth of F&I revenue (well beyond what many investors believed was possible) has essentially offset the secular compression in new and used vehicle margins such that “front-end yields” have remained relatively stable. However, ff vehicle margins continue to compress and F&I revenue growth stalls, both revenue and earnings for the group would be impacted unfavorably.\n",

        "Risks": "Government Sales and Cyclical Industries: In 2023, DOV generated approximately 78% of our net sales in the U.S., heavily influenced by the U.S. governmental and municipal markets. This reliance, coupled with exposure to cyclical industrial markets and a weak European economy, creates significant risk. Sequestration, a fragile municipal market, and economic downturns could all lead to lower sales, reduced cash flow, and delayed payments from customers, necessitating diversification efforts to mitigate these risks. Since the U.S. government and municipalities rely significantly on tax revenues affected by government policies for their spending, there is typically a one to two-year lag between the state of the U.S. economy and our sales to these government entities.\nInternational risk. FSS generates about 22% of its sales from customers outside the United States. Operating and selling internationally exposes the company to various risks that could adversely impact sales volumes, growth rates, and profitability. The current European economic weakness, lack of available business and consumer credit, and any potential future economic decline could negatively affect business and operational results. Moreover, operating internationally presents a complex risk landscape. FSS must navigate compliance with a web of U.S. and foreign regulations while also being vulnerable to economic and political instability in overseas markets.\nNew product development risk: High market share doesn't guarantee future success for FSS. Their dependence on new product development creates a risk of unpredictable R&D expenses. In terms of new product development, Federal Signal is focusing on enhancing their product offerings to meet growing customer demand. This includes advancements in their EV initiatives, which they expect to contribute to gradual sales growth. While they invest heavily in innovation, there's no certainty that new offerings will generate sufficient revenue to justify the costs. This raises the risk of wasted resources and missed market opportunities.\nGlobal Supply China and Labour: Although the majority of its purchases are currently from North American sources, Federal Signal (FSS) faces risks from global supply chain disruptions impacting truck delivery. While global supply chain conditions improved in 2023, component shortages may persist into 2024. Additionally, if the supply of skilled labor is constrained or if the costs of attracting and maintaining a workforce increase, FSS could experience decreased profit margins and reduced ability to maximize production and meet customer demand. This underscores the importance of proactive measures in supply chain management and workforce planning to mitigate potential risks.\nData Integrity and Cybersecurity: Federal Signal (FSS) faces significant data and cybersecurity risks due to its reliance on IT systems and networks, many managed by third parties. Increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats could compromise sensitive information, disrupt operations, and harm the company's reputation and financial health. Despite robust security measures, the risk of breaches remains. Additionally, protecting intellectual property is crucial, but global IP laws can be unpredictable and hard to enforce, especially in certain foreign jurisdictions. Failure to safeguard IP could adversely impact FSS's competitive position and financial stability.\nAcquisition risks. FSS is actively pursuing a growth strategy through acquisitions. While acquiring companies can be a fast way to expand, it also introduces integration risks. Specifically, applying the 80/20 rule to extract value from acquired companies might lead to execution challenges and slow down the integration cycle.\n",

An unexpected/greater-than-expected increase in such materials/costs would unfavorably impact gross margins, and 2) that the semiconductor shortage persists for longer than expected or does not get resolved, leading to further cuts to GLVP.

However, any economic deterioration, especially if it impacts upper middle class and wealthy Chinese segments could have a negative impact on Macau. Our long-term view is based on our belief that China's GDP growth will continue in mid-single digits, the economy will continue to shift towards greater consumer spend and the numbers of individuals achieving income levels sufficient to visit Macau will continue to grow.

        "Risks": "Macro slowdown/deterioration. Although the auto retailers' revenue tends to be less cyclical than their OEM and supplier peers due to the somewhat counter-cyclical nature of their Service & Parts businesses (the greatest contributor to their gross profit) and their more flexible cost structures, they are still susceptible to economic volatility.\nAccelerating shift to EVs. Despite claims to the contrary by some, we believe that the shift to EVs could prove detrimental to the auto retailers' Service & Parts business. In fact, highly regarded Consumer Reports recently published the results of a study which showed that lifetime maintenance and repair costs for EVs and PHEVs were 50% lower than those for ICE vehicles ($4,600 vs. $9,200):\n\n\nThis could impact the dealers as the Service & Parts business 1) is typically the most recession-resistant of all their businesses and 2) comprises the greatest proportion of gross profit. Thus, a decline in Service & Parts revenue could both diminish the overall profitability of these companies, and make them more cyclical. That said, there are mitigating factors such as 1) the continued significant increase in vehicle complexity with increased electronic content and electrification, could enable the dealers to capture an increasing proportion of total Service and Parts revenue, and 2) with EV penetration in the US and globally now in just the low single digit range, the path to significant EV penetration is likely to be a long one, giving this group many years to adjust and adapt. Note that increased vehicle complexity has helped drive mid-single digit revenue growth for nearly all the dealers for the past several years and it is expected to continue.\nSlowing of/an inhospitable M&A environment. Given their significant free cash flow generation, one of the reliable avenues for growth for Auto Retailers has been M&A. For example Lithia has been a chronic and successful acquiror and plans to acquire an additional $20B in revenue over the next five years (in addition to other growth initiatives). Thus, to the extent that the M&A environment becomes less friendly, either via fewer/less willing sellers, higher prices, or both – this could unfavorably impact growth plans. That said, while interest in selling amongst smaller operators was robust even pre-pandemic as many of them faced generational succession issues, interest has reportedly spiked higher post-pandemic as many small operators have found it difficult to compete with larger dealer groups as their resources, online capabilities, etc. pale in comparison -- very similar to the dynamics in the dining and broader retail sectors where the largest entities are thriving while smaller ones face difficulty keeping pace.\nHigher U.S. tax rates. As these companies are very profitable, the auto retailers were large beneficiaries of the reduction in U.S tax rates a few years ago (for examples, PAG effective tax rate declined from 32.6% in 2017 to 24.3% in 2018). Thus, the potential for higher tax rates under a new administration could be punitive to the auto retailers given their significant profit bases and having few, if any, Deferred Tax Assets to mitigate the impact.\nStall in Finance & Insurance revenue growth. The continued unrelenting growth of F&I revenue (well beyond what many investors believed was possible) has essentially offset the secular compression in new and used vehicle margins such that “front-end yields” have remained relatively stable. However, ff vehicle margins continue to compress and F&I revenue growth stalls, both revenue and earnings for the group would be impacted unfavorably.\n",

The company’s lumber segment pricing is very volatile and thus the segment margins are very volatile. Changes in the supply/demand dynamic for lumber can have material swings on segment profitability and on profitability for PCH as a whole.\nExcess standing timber in the US South. One of the attractive characteristics of timber is that trees keep growing if they are not harvested. This however, may create situations during periods of demand weakness (ie. in the aftermath of the sharp correction in housing post 2008), where standing timber inventory will continue to accumulate. Data is not robust for this analysis but certain Southern geographies appear to still have excess inventory, which would act to impede pricing recovery as housing demand improves and new lumber capacity starts up in the South. For its part, PCH management is upbeat on the medium outlook for fiber demand improvement in its wood baskets, previously gesturing to a long list of projects in various stages of development that could eventually amount to an estimated ~12MM tons of incremental wood demand, two-thirds pulpwood, one-third sawtimber.\nWeakness in Asian demand for North American logs and lumber.

        "Risks": "Prices: The primary risk for RS is steel and metals price movements that are the predominant governing factor of earnings overshadowing demand trends that we view as a secondary driver. During pricing upcycles the company tends to benefit from inventory holding gains that result in above normal margins and returns. Conversely, during a deflationary environment margins tend to compress below the through cycle average.\nSupply-Demand: Steel and companies are highly cyclical with often outsized moves relative to the broader economy. Changes in demand because of cyclical trends and from key end markets such as construction, auto-transports, and general manufacturing are all notable risks. Changes in policy, including infrastructure spending levels as well as incentives (or lack thereof) for re-shoring manufacturing, are both notable risks and potential opportunities.\nSecular Trends: Long-term secular shifts in steel consumption can pose both risk and opportunity. Improving yield loss over recent decades and greater indirect, downstream, steel trade are both notable long-term risks for the company and sector. Additionally, as an economy enters its developed stage following growth, there tends to be a lower need for steel and metals on a per capita basis. All these factors have weighed on steel consumption over the long term and will continue to in the coming decades.\nTrade: Trade policy, changes, or introductions of tariffs is also a risk. Changes in trade policy can have a significant impact on steel pricing given global trade flows. The US, as well as other countries, have been particularly aggressive on the trade policy front for decades, aiming to protect the domestic industry from overcapacity issues in other regions and/or dumped products. Changes to policy, in particular, a reduction or removal of prior tariffs implemented can pose risk for the company.\nCapacity: Upstream steel and metals capacity, specifically overcapacity, both domestically and globally are risks for downstream distributors as it influences pricing. Over the past 20 plus years' overcapacity in China for steel and metals has been a significant headwind for the global market, tempering more robust pricing fundamentals. In the future developing markets in other areas of the world pose a risk of overcapacity. During periods of tight supply-demand, adequate steel and metals availability is a risk.\nFinancial: Equity investing presents its own sets of risks given the potential for shares to reach zero under extreme circumstances. The steel and metals sector exhibits outsized volatility largely driven by product price movements and the highly cyclical nature of the businesses. Based on the health of credit markets, refinancing existing debt and revolvers may pose risk as well, in extreme cases lacking availability of lenders.\n",

That said, ERDs are a small portion of the cost to develop a large SWRO facility. Performance and OpEx have historically been the drivers of sales. However, if stricter brine disposal regulations add structural costs to SWRO developments, it is possible that all manner of cost reduction elsewhere may be entertained.\n\nThe main risk we see in WW is the company’s ability to develop new relationships with industrial end users. China and India are particular areas of focus and ERII has already acknowledged that it needs select 3rd-party partnerships to help in this regard.\n\nCO2 refrigeration currently has very little presence in the US supermarket space.

        "Risks": "Prices: The primary risk for GSM silicon and alloys price movements relative to input costs which is the predominant governing factor of earnings overshadowing demand trends that we view as a secondary driver. During pricing upcycles, the company tends to benefit from outsized spreads that result in above normal margins and returns. Conversely, during a deflationary environment, margins tend to compress below the through cycle average.\nSupply-Demand: Metals companies are highly cyclical with often outsized moves relative to the broader economy. Changes in demand because of cyclical trends and from key end markets such as chemicals, aluminum, and steel are all notable risks. Changes in policy, specifically the re-shoring of certain manufacturing industries such as solar could have notable implications for the company.\nSecular Trends: Long-term secular shifts in consumption can pose both risk and opportunity. The move towards more solar electricity generation could evolve into a notable driver for silicon metals demand. However, implications for the company have yet to be determined given localization of the supply-chain, or lack thereof for the time being. Increasing EV production and related battery demand could evolve into an opportunity to the degree silicon is used as an input if it were to replace or compliment current materials.\nTrade: Trade policy, changes, or introductions of tariffs is also a risk. Changes in trade policy can have a significant impact on silicon metal and alloys pricing given global trade flows. The US and EU, have been particularly aggressive on the trade policy front, aiming to protect the domestic industry from overcapacity issues in other regions and/or dumped products. Changes to policy, in particular, a reduction or removal of prior tariffs implemented can pose risk for the company.\nCapacity: Upstream silicon and alloys capacity, specifically overcapacity, both domestically and globally, are risks for the company as it influences pricing. Over the past decades, overcapacity in China for silicon and alloys has been a significant headwind for the global market, tempering more robust pricing fundamentals. In the future, developing markets in other areas of the world pose a risk of overcapacity.\nFinancial: Equity investing presents its own sets of risks given the potential for shares to reach zero under extreme circumstances. The silicon and alloys sector exhibits outsized volatility largely driven by product price movements and the highly cyclical nature of the businesses. Based on the health of credit markets, refinancing existing debt and revolvers may pose risk as well, in extreme cases lacking availability of lenders, or unfavorable rates.\n",

        "Risks": "U.S. demand for electricity and, thus PWR’s offerings, is highly dependent upon GDP growth. The EIA has stated that “Electricity use and economic conditions should move together”, finding a 40-year strong correlation between real GDP growth rates and electricity consumption that, at times, was as high as 89%. Electricity usage by the C&I (commercial & industrial) sector has exhibited a 76% correlation with GDP, according to research supported by ComEd and NuGrid Power Corp. A slowdown in GDP growth, let alone a recession, could lead to a plateau or downtrend in PWR’s sales.\n\nCompute’s demand for electricity could disappoint as the nascent AI industry evolves. Relative to the expert consensus, AI’s required build out of data center capacity could prove smaller-than-anticipated if the technology continues to make efficiency strides and/or fails to demonstrate sufficient revenue generation potential. Power consumption by the U.S.’s entire constellation of data centers—so not just the AI sites, but also those supporting the cloud, cryptomining and other activities—is expected to triple as a share of total electricity usage by 2030, from just over 3% today to 10%. NextEra Energy predicts power demand will grow by 55% over the next 20 years, with AI’s appetite expected to drive 17% of that increase.\n\nPWR’s business is labor-intensive, leaving it vulnerable to trades shortages and union problems. The company’s future success depends upon its access to a sufficient pool of skilled craft labor, including pipefitters, welders, linemen, journeyman electricians, and specialist installers. In addition, PWR must be able to recruit, train, and retain supervisors and foremen. As of December 31, 2024, roughly 32% of PWR’s employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n\nPWR has a significant degree of financial leverage.\n\nPWR’s ongoing, active M&A strategy presents dealmaking risks. The company has a long, consistent history of and remains interested in making acquisitions. Since the end of 2022 alone, PWR has executed XX transactions. Recent and/or future M&A could yield a variety of disappointments, such as a mispriced valuation, dysfunctional integration, regulatory conflict, and/or financing burden.\n\nLCOE is an imperfect tool for comparing the unit costs of different power sources. The LOCE (levelized cost of electricity) is the NPV (net present value) of the unit-cost of electricity over the lifetime of a power generation system. The formula’s output represents the average revenue-per-unit of electricity (i.e. MWh) that a given type of power plant would have to earn in order to recover the sum of its capex and lifetime operating costs, usually assuming a plant service span of 20-to-40 years. Many positive outlooks for onshore turbine growth are heavily predicated on LCOE trends and analytics, which suggest that unsubsidized onshore wind has become increasingly competitive with conventional power sources, such as coal-fired and CCTG plants. Among other flaws, the LCOE oversimplifies costs; oversimplifies or simply misses project context; ignores flexibility considerations, such as whether backup thermal power or stationary storage are needed; and masks regional variability when applied to projects in different countries, according to Sakhi Shah (Energy for Growth Hub) and Morgan Bazilian (Payne Institute). The formula is also highly-sensitive to the capacity factor assumption.\n\nElectric utility sector regulation could hinder or thwart large-scale solar development. Government agencies, such as the U.S. FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), impose rules and directives on electric utilities and IPPs with respect to fees, rate design, practices, permitting, and interconnection and operating requirements. These regulatory frameworks that solar project investors, developers, and owners must operate within are subject to frequent modifications and revisions. Such changes could lower the anticipated revenue of or raise the regulatory burdens for utility-scale solar plants, thereby reducing spending on new projects.\n\nU.S. utility-scale power projects face a triad of recurring chokepoints that can cause delays. New large-scale generation projects must navigate a sclerotic permitting process, a long interconnection queue, and a supply chain that’s struggled with shortages and lead time extensions. These challenges can lead a project to fall behind schedule, request a push-out of equipment deliveries, or incur other setbacks.\n\nCommodity price volatility and downtrends. A sudden plunge or sustained decline in oil and/or natural gas prices, including LNG benchmarks, NGLs, and petroleum products, could hurt PWR’s stock and, eventually, harm its fundamentals. Many energy customers’ cash flow trends determine their capex budgets and those cash flows are partly a function of recent and anticipated commodity prices.\n",

FPL/NEE have strong regulatory/political relationships in FL and FPL's latest rate case was settled in 2021. Yet, the settlement was recently remanded to the FL utility regulatory (FL PSC) by the FL Supreme Court and the utility has been under growing media scrutiny for its lobbying practices. FPL is about to file its next multi-year rate case.\nNEE was the biggest beneficiary of cheap debt among US power producers: Excluding FPL, NEE's cash cost of debt in '22 was just 1.7% and while it jumped to 3.4% in 1H23, it's not yet reflective of recent ST/LT debt deals at 5.5%+ and $17B+ in debt maturities at NEE between now and late '25. Sharply lower interest rates could meaningfully boost NEE’s EPS and growth prospects especially beyond '26 when current interest hedged expire.\nHigh holdco debt financing wind/solar projects supported by contracts with finite lives: More than 50% of NEE’s total long-term debt is at the corporate level. The debt partly finances NEER wind and solar projects. The debt does not amortize over the duration of their power purchase agreements thus inflating operating cash flows and credit metrics of NEE. As long as NEE continues to grow and/or is able to resign the PPAs, the rolling of the corporate debt should not pose a problem. The Inflation Reduction Act provided NEE (FPL in particular) with additional levers to manage NEE’s credit metrics and unlocked additional debt capacity.\nUpside Risks:\nFPL’s superiority: FPL is one of the top performing regulated electric utilities in the US, based on practically all operational and financial metrics. FPL’s pending rate case could be resolved through a settlement and could result in a slightly higher allowed ROE than we currently estimate (11.9% vs. 11.8% we assume).\nClarity around the IRA could re-rate renewable power stocks: NEE’s P/E multiple could rebound once investors get clarity on federal regulations for renewable power. Our base case for NEE/NEER assumes no changes in the IRA and a resumption of permitting for wind/solar/battery projects on private lands, but it’s not fully clear what’s currently priced into NEE’s stock.\nLower interest rates might boost the profitability of NEE’s existing/future projects: NEE’s earnings remain shielded from higher interest rates thanks to interest rate hedges, but we have very little disclosures on those. NEE’s cash interest payments continue to rise, faster than its total debt. Lower interest rates, especially beyond 2026, could offer some earnings boost and a sentiment boost for NEE’s renewable power business which has been financed with cheap unamortizing debt.\n",

        "Tiket": " Watts Water Technologies, Inc. (WTS) ",
        "Risks": "Risks that could prevent WTS from reaching our estimates and price target include, but are not limited to:\nChannel inventory. With 64% of WTS’s sales going through wholesale plumbing distribution channels, the demand outlook from distributors could cause de-stocking from normalized levels, if the markets are expected to slow materially. In periods of de-stocking, WTS can experience significant volume and profitability declines, which can negatively impact the stock.\nRaw material costs. We believe raw materials account for roughly 65% of WTS’s cost of goods sold (COGS). Fluctuations in the price of bronze, brass, cast iron, stainless steel, steel and plastic can have a material impact of WTS’s profitability in future quarters.\nComponent part risk. We estimate that ~25% of input cost are supplied from China. Although WTS noted the company can explore strategic sourcing for key components and parts, such as their foundry in North Andover, MA. We believe business interruption or additional cost could negatively affect the company in the short term. Over the long term, we believe WTS could recover with additional pricing actions to cover the additional costs.\nInvestment spending risks. WTS is increasing its investment spending to ~$15MM. The additional cash will be used to fund projects that will setup the company for future growth. However, the water business cycle is typically long term and products last for upwards of decades. We view that additional investment spending could go to waste if the customer is not educated enough on its beneficial attributes.\nAcquisition risk. WTS recently completed the acquisition of AERCO for ~$100MM with plans to integrate the deal over the next 12 months. As with all acquisitions, there is integration risk associated with the deal and future deals WTS may pursue in the future. We believe WTS is likely to continue acquisitions in the future given the highly fragmented nature of the water space.\nMinority control. WTS maintains two share classes; Class A and Class B shares; 99% of Class B shares are held by the family of former CEO Timothy Horne. These shares are “super voting” shares that outweigh Class A shares 10-1 in voting rights. All-in, the family has 65% plus voting power compared to regular shareholders. Mr. Horne remains as board member and consultant to the company with the right to transfer his shares to common stock, representing ~20% of outstanding shares, if he were to convert. If he were to liquidate his position, share price weakness would be likely, and could impact the stock if matters were put to a vote.\nEnvironmental risk/regulatory risk; Asbestos. Watts is subject to risk regarding environmental, health and safety laws and regulations across the various national, state, provisional and local jurisdictions it operates within. WTS is currently defending 240 lawsuits in different jurisdictions, alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos. The complaints in these cases typically name a large number of defendants and do not identify any of WTS’s particular products as a source of asbestos. There have been no judgments against WTS at this time, but this is a risk in the future.\nCurrency risk. Watts has exposure to the US dollar, the euro and several other global currencies. Currency is marked to market each quarter, which presents translation risk to Watts’ P&L. Strengthening of the US dollar can reduce profitability of foreign revenues as well as the demand of exports from the US.\n",

        "Risks": "Prices: The primary risk for WS is steel price movements in the near term, which are the predominant governing factor of earnings, overshadowing demand trends, which we view as a secondary driver. During pricing upcycles, the company tends to benefit from inventory-holding gains that result in above-normal margins and returns. Conversely, margins tend to compress below the through-cycle average during a deflationary environment.\nSupply-Demand: Steel is highly cyclical, with often outsized moves relative to the broader economy. Changes in demand because of cyclical trends and from key end markets such as construction, auto transports, and general manufacturing are all notable risks. Changes in policy, including infrastructure spending levels and incentives (or lack thereof) for re-shoring manufacturing, are significant risks and potential opportunities.\nSecular Trends: Long-term secular shifts in steel consumption can pose risks and opportunities. The indirect downstream steel trade is a notable long-term risk for the company and sector. Additionally, as an economy enters its developed stage following growth, there tends to be a lower need for steel and metals per capita. All these factors have weighed on steel consumption over the long term and will continue to in the coming decades.\nTrade: Trade policy, changes, or introductions of tariffs are also risks. Changes in trade policy can have a significant impact on steel pricing, given global trade flows. The US and other countries have been particularly aggressive on the trade policy front for decades, aiming to protect the domestic industry from overcapacity issues in different regions and/or dumped products. Changes to policy, in particular, a reduction or removal of prior tariffs implemented, can pose risks for the company.\nCapacity: Upstream steel and metals capacity, specifically overcapacity, both domestically and globally, is a risk for downstream distributors and processors as it influences pricing. Over the past twenty-plus years, overcapacity in China for steel and metals has been a significant headwind for the global market, tempering more robust pricing fundamentals. In the future, developing markets in other areas of the world pose a risk of overcapacity. During periods of tight supply-demand, adequate steel and metals availability is a risk.\nFinancial: Equity investing presents its own risks, given the potential for shares to reach zero under extreme circumstances. The steel and metals sector exhibits outsized volatility primarily driven by product price movements and the highly cyclical nature of the businesses. Based on the health of credit markets, refinancing existing debt and revolvers may pose a risk as well, especially in extreme cases where lenders are unavailable.\n",

Demand for travel typically weakens in a weaker economy or political uncertainty. Additionally, other events including extreme weather, pandemics (e.g. COVID-19), terrorist attacks, regional wars, could likely impact travel to a given region.\n\nCompetition. The market for online travel companies is extremely competitive including competition from other online travel agencies, alternative accommodation providers (Airbnb), traditional travel agencies, search engines (e.g. Google).\n\nGovernment Regulations. Booking could be impacted by travel-related regulations such as local regulation of the use of alternative accommodations. Local jurisdictions for instance have instituted a variety of measures to address the issues of \"overtourism\".\n\nDependent on Supply Providers. Booking relies on providers of accommodations, rental cars, and airline tickets, and on restaurants, to make their services available to consumers through Booking Holdings.

Booking relies on marketing channels including search, social, display, TV, to generate a significant amount of traffic to its platforms and grow its business.

Many of the markets where IOSP participates have large and well-capitalized competitors, and IOSP must work closely with customers to develop and commercialize new products, or risk losing market share.\nRaw material risks. IOSP's key raw material inputs include oleochemicals (including fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and fatty amines), cetane number improvers, solvents, amines, alcohols, olefins, and polyacrylamides. Disruption in raw material supply can impact the company's ability to produce and ship finished products. Volatility in raw material costs can impact margin performance, with many products passing through pricing on a lag. Ethylene for plants in Germany is single-sourced via pipeline, where it is a primary raw material for products representing ~4% of IOSP sales.\nAcquisition risk. We believe IOSP plans to grow its business through acquisitions, which entails risks around overpayment, integration challenges, overestimation of synergies, and adverse market response.\nDeclining combustion engine demand. Over time, electric vehicles and other alternative fuels could impact demand for the additives used in gasoline and diesel. We believe this risk is most pronounced in diesel passenger cars, which account for an estimated 15% of Fuel Specialties sales.\nFurther phase-out of leaded fuel additives. AvGas is an additive used in leaded fuel for piston-engine aircraft, and regulators are seeking a replacement for leaded fuel. This process aims to eliminate lead emissions from general aviation by the end of 2030. We estimate AvGas accounts for less than 5% of sales.\nOil and gas price risk. Volatility in oil and gas prices can impact demand for Oilfield Services. While we view fuel demand as inelastic, higher fuel prices can also lead to lower demand in the Fuel Specialties business.\nEnvironmental and other regulatory risk. In addition to many of IOSP's products being subject to regulatory review, regulatory changes can impact demand (see the phase-out of tetraethyl lead beginning in the 1970s).

AFCG’s growth and success are dependent on its external manager, key personnel, and investment professionals. The ability of the external manager to make loans on favorable terms that satisfy AFCG’s investment strategy is crucial. If the external manager overestimates projected yields or incorrectly prices loan risks, AFCG may experience losses. Any adverse changes in the relationship with the manager could also harm the company’s performance.\nCannabis Industry Risks. Lending to companies in the cannabis industry presents significant risks. These include the risk of strict enforcement of federal cannabis laws against AFCG’s borrowers, potential difficulties in borrowers maintaining their licenses, and a general lack of liquidity for such loans.\nRegulatory Risk. AFCG’s ability to grow or maintain its business is dependent in part on state laws related to the cannabis industry. Adverse changes in state or national laws, or modifications to favorable enforcement guidelines regarding cannabis operations, could materially impact AFCG’s business and impede growth.\nControl Risk.

GEV plans to invest $5B, cumulatively, in R&D from 2025 through 2028. This spending will be evenly split between 1.) product industrialization and installed base initiatives for this decade, and 2.) long-term innovation focused on the next generation of products. The company must continue to actively cultivate and reposition a portfolio of patents, copyrights and contractual protections. To safeguard its trade secrets and confidential know-how, GEV must also remain vigilant about enforcing data classification, cybersecurity, and NDA policies.\n\nFor over a decade, the U.S. has had volatile and disruptive industrial, trade, and energy policies. Take the Paris Climate Accords, for example: since the agreement was signed in 2016, the U.S. has entered the treaty, withdrawn in 2020, rejoined in 2021, and just exited again—all via executive orders. In During his first presidency, President Trump’s tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico collectively impacted about 5% of GEV’s annual direct spend at that time of $20B. So far in his second term, the White House has broadened and escalated its use of tariffs as a multi-purpose tool to achieve several goals. Based on enacted, paused, and planned universal and sectorial tariffs, management estimates that GEV will sustain a net blow of $300MM-to-$400MM in 2025, after factoring in the company’s contractual protections and mitigating actions. If and as tariffs increase in breadth and/or severity, the cost to GEV could be worse than its guidance assumes.\n\nLCOE is an imperfect tool for comparing the unit costs of different power sources. The LOCE (levelized cost of electricity) is the NPV (net present value) of the unit-cost of electricity over the lifetime of a power generation system. The formula’s output represents the average revenue-perunit of electricity (i.e. MWh) that a given type of power plant would have to earn in order to recover the sum of its capex and lifetime operating costs, usually assuming a plant service span of 20-to40 years. Many positive outlooks for onshore turbine growth are heavily predicated on LCOE trends and analytics, which suggest that unsubsidized onshore wind has become increasingly competitive with conventional power sources, such as coal-fired and CCTG plants. Among other flaws, the LCOE oversimplifies costs; oversimplifies or simply misses project context; ignores flexibility considerations, such as whether backup thermal power or stationary storage are needed; and masks regional variability when applied to projects in different countries, according to Sakhi Shah (Energy for Growth Hub) and Morgan Bazilian (Payne Institute). The formula is also highly-sensitive to the capacity factor assumption.\n\nRenewables development is heavily dependent upon government “carrots and sticks”. By “carrots and sticks”, we mean a government’s full policy apparatus of subsidies, incentives, grants, loans, and regulatory standards or mandates. This is particularly true in the U.S. and Europe, which accounted for 42% and 24%, respectively, of GEV’s 2024 revenue. For the economic viability of many large-scale solar, storage, and wind facilities in the U.S. project pipeline, developers and owners are relying on vital aspects of the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act), particularly its tax credits (i.e. the ITC, PTC, and domestic content bonus), and the BIL (Bipartisan Infrastructure Law). Across the Atlantic, Brussels has introduced two legislative and regulatory packages, REPowerEU and the Green Deal Industrial Plan, designed to push renewables investment toward the European Commission’s targets.\n\nCommodity price volatility and downtrends. A sudden plunge or sustained decline in oil and/or natural gas prices, including LNG benchmarks, NGLs, and petroleum products, could hurt GEV’s stock and, eventually, harm its fundamentals. Many energy customers’ cash flow trends determine their capex budgets and those cash flows are partly a function of recent and anticipated commodity prices.\n\nU.S. utility-scale power projects face a triad of recurring chokepoints that can cause delays. New large-scale generation projects must navigate a sclerotic permitting process, a long interconnection queue, and a supply chain that’s struggled with shortages and lead time extensions. These challenges can lead a project to fall behind schedule, request a push-out of equipment deliveries, or incur other setbacks.\n\nRegulated utilities don’t directly control their capex budgets. Most regulated utilities operated under a cost-of-service regulatory (COSR) model, which means they don’t have full autonomy over their investment budgets. The utility determines an investment budget based on factors such as the load growth and aging infrastructure needs of its electric system and then submits that proposed capex as part of an overall rate case. The regulator, such as the CPUC in California, then reviews the rate case and can reject certain capex items.\n\nFailure to preserve its investment grade credit ratings could hurt GEV’s financial performance. Currently, GEV’s credit outlook and long-term rating from 1.) S&P (Standard and Poor’s Global Ratings) is Stable and BBB-, and 2.) Fitch (Fitch Ratings) is Stable and BBB. If its rating were to be downgraded to below BBB-, then GEV could suffer a decrease in borrowing and bonding capacity, an increase in interest expense and/or other costs of capital, and/or a diminishment in its commercial stature and relationships\n\nGEV’s international operations expose it to shifts in geopolitical dynamics and FX rates. Outside of the U.S., GEV’s manufacturing, component production, and assembly footprint spans 73 factories, including 11 in the rest of the Americas, 25 in ASEAN, and 37 in EMEA. In addition, the company maintains a sprawling network of leased and owned offices, warehouses, and distribution facilities. Some of these sites are in countries that have a recent history of sociopolitical instability (e.g. civil unrest, acts of terrorism) and/or nearby areas of ongoing kinetic conflict. For example, GEV has facilities at five locations—Elbląg, Goleniów, Katowice, Warsaw, and Wrocław—in Poland, which has the Russo-Ukrainian war just over its southeastern border. Similarly, in the multi-hot spot Middle East, the company has various sites, such as its Dammam GEMTEC campus, GESAT joint venture, and Khobar Integration Facility in Saudi Arabia, and SAIF (Sharjah Airport International Free) Zone warehouse in the UAE. GEV also has exposure to foreign currency exchange rate volatility, especially in the Euro and British pound sterling.\n",

Management now plans to use the COD flexibility to boost the profitability of its future projects through delayed purchases of solar panels, and initial merchant operations of some of its solar projects. RNW removed CODs from its project pipeline, and we have very limited visibility into each of the new build projects.\nVariability in wind/solar power generation volumes: ~60% of ReNew's current generation capacity is wind-powered, and those facilities are subject to more power output variability that solar plants. ReNew's wind plants saw weak plant load factors (PLFs) during FY21 and FY22, but some notable improvement in output in FY1Q23.\nEBITDA margins might not be sustainable due to competition and rising cost of solar/wind equipment: EBITDA margins for renewable power operators/developers in excess of 80% are widely seen as strong, and ReNew’s management targets margins of 85-86%. The company seems disciplined at bidding in new renewable power auctions, and the growth in ReNew’s operating portfolio should allow for some expansion in EBITDA margins. Yet, growing competition for new wind/solar projects and higher cost of equipment (due to supply constraints and approaching import duties) could weigh on future margins. The company plans to self-supply solar modules, but the manufacturing facility has yet to be built.\nIndia-related macro risks: ReNew operates exclusively in India, and while its operating/committed facilities are spread across nine states in the country, the company is exposed to changes in India's laws and regulations, including taxation. In 2020, India's Prime Minister set a 450GW renewable capacity target by 2030, but the target could be revised due to the current COVID-related economic slowdown or other policy reasons. Those changes could have a material adverse impact on ReNew's growth prospects beyond the committed capacity. Our 2022-2025 EBITDA projections do not account for any incremental growth, but ReNew's listing on the NASDAQ is highly linked to longer-term growth prospects in India.\nFX risks: ReNew’s revenues and operating costs are denominated in Indian rupees, but some of its capex (imported equipment) and 50% of debt are denominated in US dollars.

We estimate about half of the surfactants business is commodity volume that helps base-load plants. Most of this is sold to large consumer products companies, some of which have in-house surfactant production capacity. Over time, we expect more of the business to transition to specialties, but commodities are subject to low customer switching costs and compete primarily on price.\nPolymers faces some unique risks. SCL benefits as energy efficiency standards for construction move higher, so any slowing in that trend could be unfavorable. We also believe Polymers has seen intensifying competitive dynamics that can impact SCL's ability to achieve price increases.

        "Risks": "The global economy is struggling with raw material shortages and logistics challenges. TPIC is not immune to the associated systematic risks. The company’s long-term supply agreements are structured so that customers share in cost increases due to raw material inflation. In most cases, this cost sharing occurs via a 70/30 mechanism that resets quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. Nevertheless, TPIC could still be hurt by such cost fluctuations and/or struggle with the procurement-through-delivery of inputs in the amounts and at the times necessary. Vital materials for both of the two types of blades that TPIC makes, carbon and glass, include: resin (18% of carbon and 31% of glass), glass (17% and 27%), adhesive (5% and 7%), and coatings (2% and 4%).\nLCOE is an imperfect tool for comparing the unit costs of different power sources. The LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) is the NPV (net present value) of the unit-cost of electricity over the lifetime of a power generation system.

The formula is also highly-sensitive to the capacity factor assumption.\nTPIC’s model entails a high degree of customer concentration. In 2018, 2019, and 2020, TPIC’s top four customers accounted for 94%, 93%, and 72% of consolidated revenue. Some of TPIC’s long-term supply agreements contain provisions that allow for an early termination if the customer provides sufficient advanced written notice and pays a fee. Their annual MVOs also tend to decline in later years. The current crop of long-term agreements are set to expire between the end of 2021 and the end of 2024.\nIf the trend toward outsourcing for blade manufacturing were to reverse course, it could severely damage TPIC's earnings power. Although it’s outsourced an ever larger share of annual blade manufacturing requirements over the past decade, the wind turbine OEM industry is still dominated by players who maintain and rely upon in-house production for sizeable portions of their blade volume. Since 2009, the insourced/outsourced split for global blade manufacturing has flipped from 62%/38% to 37%/63%. Even adjusting for GE’s acquisition of LM Wind Power in 2017, the current split is still roughly 40%/60%.\nTPIC has globally diversified and heavily localized footprint. In 2018, 2019, and 2020, TPIC derived 84%, 88%, and 89% of revenue, respectively, from a multi-county manufacturing and tooling, engineering, and R&D operation outside of the U.S. Customers may have ultimately installed 50-60% of TPIC’s blades at wind farms in the U.S., but TPIC relied upon its foreign footprint to produce and deliver them. Of the company’s 11 leased wind blade manufacturing plants, four are in Mexico, three in China, two in Turkey, and one in India. This exposes TPIC to the full array of heightened or unique hazards posed by developing countries, including currency volatility, legal limitations, regulatory uncertainties, economic turbulence, domestic unrest, and geopolitical conflict.\nIt’s unclear how much or quickly Vortex Bladeless’s technology could be scaled up. Vortex is developing a prototype device, called the Vortex Tacoma, that creates and then harnesses energy from vortex shedding: as wind flows across it, the Tacoma oscillates and generates electricity from those vibrations. According to inventor and CEO David Yanez, the Tacoma is “small and would generate small amounts of electricity. But we are looking for an industrial partner to scale up our plans to a 140 meter turbine with a power capacity of 1 MW”.\n",

        "Risks": "The pace of EV adoption faces challenges that could result in disappointing sales volume. For most years over the past decade, the global fleet tally and sales volume of passenger EV (electric vehicles) has fallen short of much earlier bullish forecasts of where both would be by that juncture. EVs continue to confront three major obstacles to a broader and faster rate of adoption: relative cost, drive range anxiety, and inadequate charging infrastructure. According to consumer surveys conducted by Castrol, 63% of participant believed that EVs are beyond their budget and 57% expressed concerns about possible depreciation due to how quickly the technology is changing. More than 70% of consumers said that sufficient total range is critical to them. Finally, 64% of consumers have indicated they would consider an EV if the charging process was improved, with regards to both charge times and infrastructure access.\nPyroThin orders under ASPN’s first contract will be a function of that OEM’s EV sales. Under its first and still only thermal barriers production volume contract, ASPN’s expected annual revenue ramp and run rate is predicated on the anonymous automaker’s EV sales and market share projections. As the OEM, who we’re highly confident is GM, launches new models from its proprietary battery platform, the commercial outcomes of those EVs will dictate ASPN’s order flow.\nManufacturing is reliant upon a single facility until ASPN’s second plant comes online. Until plant #2 starts up in 2023, ASPN will be entirely dependent on its facility in East Providence, R.I. for the manufacture of Pyrogel, PyroThin, and all of the company’s other products.\nPlant #2 will likely need additional external financing to reach maximum revenue capacity. Beyond the construction of its initial phases, which should be covered by a combination of the KSP private placement proceeds and ASPN’s CFFO, plant #2 is likely to require additional capital. Management has acknowledged this is a likely intermediate term scenario. If and when ASPN should require capital, be it to complete plant #2 or for some other growth investment, management remains open to a variety of options, such as accepting customer or partner financing, issuing equity, and/or assuming debt.\nKoch Strategic Platforms (KSP) owns a significant equity stake. Following a private placement, KSP owns 3,462,124 shares representing approximately 11% of ASPN’s common stock outstanding.\nEnergy infrastructure could experience delays in big project orders or awards. From an initial FEED study to major equipment awards to final installation, each milestone for a sizeable oil & gas development project is susceptible to delays or protraction. An event’s timing can drift out on the calendar by several months, taking it into a later quarter or calendar year than consensus estimates assume.\n",

        "Risks": "Macro slowdown/deterioration. Although the auto retailers' revenue tends to be less cyclical than their OEM and supplier peers due to the somewhat counter-cyclical nature of their Service & Parts businesses (the greatest contributor to their gross profit) and their more flexible cost structures, they are still susceptible to economic volatility.\nAccelerating shift to EVs. Despite claims to the contrary by some, we believe that the shift to EVs could prove detrimental to the auto retailers' Service & Parts business. In fact, highly regarded Consumer Reports recently published the results of a study which showed that lifetime maintenance and repair costs for EVs and PHEVs were 50% lower than those for ICE vehicles ($4,600 vs. $9,200):\n\n\nThis could impact the dealers as the Service & Parts business 1) is typically the most recession-resistant of all their businesses and 2) comprises the greatest proportion of gross profit. Thus, a decline in Service & Parts revenue could both diminish the overall profitability of these companies, and make them more cyclical. That said, there are mitigating factors such as 1) the continued significant increase in vehicle complexity with increased electronic content and electrification, could enable the dealers to capture an increasing proportion of total Service and Parts revenue, and 2) with EV penetration in the US and globally now in just the low single digit range, the path to significant EV penetration is likely to be a long one, giving this group many years to adjust and adapt. Note that increased vehicle complexity has helped drive mid-single digit revenue growth for nearly all the dealers for the past several years and it is expected to continue.\nSlowing of/an inhospitable M&A environment. Given their significant free cash flow generation, one of the reliable avenues for growth for Auto Retailers has been M&A. For example Lithia has been a chronic and successful acquiror and plans to acquire an additional $20B in revenue over the next five years (in addition to other growth initiatives). Thus, to the extent that the M&A environment becomes less friendly, either via fewer/less willing sellers, higher prices, or both – this could unfavorably impact growth plans. That said, while interest in selling amongst smaller operators was robust even pre-pandemic as many of them faced generational succession issues, interest has reportedly spiked higher post-pandemic as many small operators have found it difficult to compete with larger dealer groups as their resources, online capabilities, etc. pale in comparison -- very similar to the dynamics in the dining and broader retail sectors where the largest entities are thriving while smaller ones face difficulty keeping pace.\nHigher U.S. tax rates. As these companies are very profitable, the auto retailers were large beneficiaries of the reduction in U.S tax rates a few years ago (for examples, PAG effective tax rate declined from 32.6% in 2017 to 24.3% in 2018). Thus, the potential for higher tax rates under a new administration could be punitive to the auto retailers given their significant profit bases and having few, if any, Deferred Tax Assets to mitigate the impact.\nStall in Finance & Insurance revenue growth. The continued unrelenting growth of F&I revenue (well beyond what many investors believed was possible) has essentially offset the secular compression in new and used vehicle margins such that “front-end yields” have remained relatively stable. However, ff vehicle margins continue to compress and F&I revenue growth stalls, both revenue and earnings for the group would be impacted unfavorably.\n",

        "Risks": "Prices: The primary risk for RDUS is scrap price movements relative to purchase costs (often referred to as spreads in the industry) that are the predominant governing factor of earnings, overshadowing demand trends that we view as a secondary driver. This spans ferrous, nonferrous, and PGM products. During pricing upcycles, the company tends to benefit from inventory outsized spreads that result in above-normal margins and returns. Conversely, during a deflationary environment, margins tend to compress below the through-cycle average.\n\nSupply-Demand: Recycling companies are highly cyclical, with often outsized moves relative to the broader economy. Changes in demand because of cyclical trends and from key steel and metals end markets such as construction, auto-transports, and general manufacturing are all notable risks. Given RDUS's significant export exposure, changes in overseas market fundamentals are meaningful. Changes in policy, including infrastructure spending levels and incentives (or lack thereof) for re-shoring manufacturing, are notable risks and potential opportunities.\n\nSecular Trends: Long-term secular shifts in steel consumption can pose risks and opportunities. Greater indirect, downstream steel trade is both a notable long-term risk for the company and sector to the degree it displaces steel production within its markets. Additionally, as an economy enters its developed stage following growth, there tends to be a lower need for steel and metals per capita. All these factors have weighed on steel consumption over the long term and will continue to in the coming decades. A positive trend within the domestic market has been an increasing share of EAF steel production that is more scrap-intensive.\n\nTrade: Trade policy, changes, or introductions of tariffs are also risks. Changes in trade policy can have a significant impact on global trade flows. The US and other countries have been particularly aggressive on the trade policy front for decades, aiming to protect the domestic industry from overcapacity issues in other regions and/or dumped products. Changes to policy, in particular, a reduction or removal of prior tariffs implemented, can pose a risk for the company. More general changes in trade flows, especially from large steel producing countries such as China, also pose risk.\n\nCapacity: Upstream steel and metals capacity, specifically overcapacity, both domestically and globally, can be a risk depending on the location. Over the past 20 plus years' overcapacity in China for steel and metals has been a significant headwind for the global market, tempering more robust pricing fundamentals and often taking share from other markets. In the future, developing markets in other areas of the world will pose a risk of overcapacity and subsequent export pressure.\n\nFinancial: Equity investing presents its own sets of risks, given the potential for shares to reach zero under extreme circumstances. The steel and metals sector exhibits outsized volatility largely driven by product price movements and the highly cyclical nature of the businesses. Based on the health of credit markets, refinancing existing debt and revolvers may pose a risk as well, in extreme cases lacking availability of lenders or unfavorable rates.\n",

Future declines in used car prices could unwind many of these favorable impacts. Auto loan originations are currently a small part of LC’s business but are expected to be a future growth driver.\nCredit Quality and Loan Underwriting Standards – Credit scores have migrated higher as government stimulus payments have helped borrowers stay current on existing loans and/or pay down debt obligations.

        "Tiket": " First Solar Inc. (FSLR) ",
        "Risks": "LCOE is an imperfect tool for comparing the unit costs of different power sources. The LOCE (levelized cost of electricity) is the NPV (net present value) of the unit-cost of electricity over the lifetime of a power generation system. The formula’s output represents the average revenue-per-unit of electricity (i.e. MWh) that a given type of power plant would have to earn in order to recover the sum of its capex and lifetime operating costs, usually assuming a plant service span of 20-to-40 years. Many positive outlooks for onshore turbine growth are heavily predicated on LCOE trends and analytics, which suggest that unsubsidized onshore wind has become increasingly competitive with conventional power sources, such as coal-fired and CCTG plants. Among other flaws, the LCOE oversimplifies costs; oversimplifies or simply misses project context; ignores flexibility considerations, such as whether backup thermal power or stationary storage are needed; and masks regional variability when applied to projects in different countries, according to Sakhi Shah (Energy for Growth Hub) and Morgan Bazilian (Payne Institute). The formula is also highly-sensitive to the capacity factor assumption.\nDemand for FSLR’s offerings is a straight function of utility-scale solar development. ARRY’s customer base – developers, IPPs, and utilities – order its products based on assumptions about the economic viability and consumption trajectory for solar energy. If investment in large-scale solar plants and parks should cease growing, then the company’s sales could stagnate or trend down. As it has historically, the level of solar plant and park spending should continue to be determined by a variety of macro factors, such as global through regional GDP growth rates, electricity usage trends, the relative economics of rival power generation sources, government policies and regulations, available financing options, and the supply and cost of labor, raw materials, and components.\nSolar competes with other fuel sources within the power mix. A new solar plant scheme often confronts rival proposals centered on other electricity generation sources, such as a coal-fired, CCGT (combined cycle gas turbine), nuclear, or wind facility. Solar competes with these alternatives mainly on the basis of price dynamics and predictability, the availability and dispatchability of the fuel source, the ease with which the output can be used, and logistical considerations.\nGovernment curtailment of incentives and/or mandates could hurt solar project spending. FSLR sells most of its tracker systems for grid-connected applications, wherein the produced solar electricity is sold into an organized wholesale market or under a PPA (power purchase agreement). This grid-connected segment of the solar industry has historically relied in large part on the availability and size of government policies that promote renewables. Such policies take the form of tax credits, rebates, mandates, and/or financial “carrots and sticks” to incentivize the development of solar energy infrastructure by owners, end users, distributors, and equipment providers.\nFSLR’s business India is being harmed by Chinese dumping. The Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry has recently initiated an investigation into the issue but has yet to announce its conclusions, let alone a plan of action\nFSLR’s competitiveness is reliant on its ability to defend vital proprietary knowledge. The company depends on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, and confidentiality agreements to protect its intellectual property.\nAcute trade tensions, especially between the U.S. and China, could result in harmful tariffs. Simmering trade conflicts can lead to the imposition of or increases in tariffs, duties, and import restrictions. Flare-ups between the U.S. and China have already resulted in tariffs on both tracker inputs, such as steel, and on other vital solar farm components, such as modules and PV cells. The solar industry faces ongoing uncertainty about the punitive and retaliatory risks posed by the tense Sino-U.S. trade relationship. Among other negative impacts, FSLR could experience a contraction in overall customer demand, project timeline delays, and/or a deterioration in its profit margins.\nElectric utility sector regulation could hinder or thwart large-scale solar development. Government agencies, such as the U.S. FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), impose rules and directives on electric utilities and IPPs with respect to fees, rate design, practices, permitting, and interconnection and operating requirements. These regulatory frameworks that solar project investors, developers, and owners must operate within are subject to frequent modifications and revisions. Such changes could lower the anticipated revenue of or raise the regulatory burdens for utility-scale solar plants, thereby reducing spending on new projects.\n",

The current economic situation, particularly in the energy markets, is having a negative impact on demand for certain products. Also, the recent strength in the US dollar impacts the prices ROCK charges and costs incurred to export and import products. Despite the current stability in the construction markets, the tepid global economy still provides potential risk to ROCK’s businesses.\nCompetitive market risk. Most of the company's products are sold in competitive markets. Competition is based primarily on quality, price, raw material and inventory availability, and the ability to meet delivery schedules dictated by customers. Increased competition could force the company to lower prices or to offer additional services or enhanced products at a higher cost to ROCK, which could reduce gross profit, net income and cash flow and cause the company to lose market share.\nRaw material risk. The company is sensitive to price movements in raw material supply base, particularly with regard to steel, aluminum and resins. Volatility in raw material prices can significantly affect ROCK’s costs. In an environment of increasing raw material prices, competitive conditions will impact how much of the steel price increases ROCK can pass on to customers. To the extent the company is unable to pass on price increases in raw materials to customers, the profitability of the business and resulting cash flows would be adversely affected. In the event of rapidly decreasing raw material prices, the company may be left to absorb the cost of higher cost inventory as customers receive reduced pricing related to decreases in raw material costs. To the extent the company is unable to match costs to purchase raw materials to prices given to its customers, the profitability of the business and resulting cash flows could be adversely affected.\nSupplier risk. The company could be significantly and adversely affected if delivery were disrupted from a major supplier or several suppliers. In addition, the company does not have long-term contracts with any of its suppliers. If, in the future, ROCK is unable to obtain sufficient amounts of the necessary metals at competitive prices and on a timely basis from its traditional suppliers, it may not be able to obtain such metals from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet its delivery schedules, which would have a material adverse effect on ROCK’s results, profitability and cash flow.\nEmployee retention risk. The company depends on the services of key individuals and relationships, including CEO Frank Heard. The loss of one of these key individuals could have a significant negative impact on the business. The efforts of senior management are the basis of success, and its future success will still depend on qualified personnel. The failure to attract or retain key employees could negatively affect the company's financial results.\nLabor force disruption risk. Approximately 12% of ROCK’s employees are represented by unions through various collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). Three of the CBAs expire and will be renegotiated in 2015. It is likely that the unionized employees will seek an increase in wages and benefits at the expiration of these agreements, and the company may be unable to negotiate new agreements without labor disruption or on terms favorable to ROCK. In addition, labor organizing activities could occur at any of the facilities. If any labor disruption were to occur at the company’s facilities, ROCK could lose sales due to interruptions in production and could incur additional costs, which would adversely affect net sales, results of operations and cash flow.\n",

A significant change in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the company’s cost structure and therefore the ability to sell products. The best situation for NDSN is when the US dollar is getting devalued, which has been the case for the last several years. Recently, however, most international governments have been devaluing their currencies and the US dollar has been increasing in value, which is a negative for NDSN's sales and profits.\nManagement retention risk: NDSN believes that much of its success can be attributed to the management team and other key personnel. If the company fails to retain its existing management team or is unable to attract qualified personnel, business operations could be affected and growth could be decreased. Inefficient management could directly diminish profits and product development.\nIntellectual property risk: NDSN must protect itself from claims relating to intellectual property.

Both require a high degree of technology development; 2) investors have come to expect shipbuilding to be a very steady state and predictable business - as such volatility caused by its Technical Service business or production programs can result in an outsized stock reaction; 3) HII has recently had issues at its ship repair facility in San Diego - however, HII is taking steps to mitigate that reducing the potential for further issues. is expanding into new markets requiring highly sophisticated technology development – there is always risk of an execution issues.\n",

        "Tiket": " Kadant Inc. (KAI) ",
        "Risks": "Economic and Industrial slowdown risk: KAI faces persistent risks from disappointing Material Handling due to a prolonged slowdown in industrial and cyclical mining bookings, driven by sluggish demand across all three segments. Despite aftermarket parts revenue comprising ~65%-70% of the total and helping to offset stagnant capital equipment revenue, the general slowdown in manufacturing activity in regions such as Europe and Asia pose significant challenges. Economic uncertainty and shrinking backlogs are expected to contribute to slower growth trends in the manufacturing sector, with potential headwinds from industrial performance in China and Europe (+30% sales) likely to impact broad industrial demand for the foreseeable future. These challenges could persist beyond the next two years, affecting KAI's long-term growth and stability.\nAcquisition Risk: KAI is actively pursuing a growth strategy through acquisitions, which introduces significant integration risks. Applying the 80/20 rule to extract value from acquired companies can lead to execution challenges and slow down the integration cycle. The acquisition of Key Knife, for instance, bolstered gross margins by contributing higher-margin parts and consumables. However, acquisition-related expenses and wage increases can offset these benefits. Without thorough evaluation and improvement of the operating processes of acquired businesses, KAI’s profitability could be compromised. The complexities of merging disparate corporate cultures, systems, and procedures often result in higher-than-anticipated integration expenses and potential business disruptions. These risks, along with market unpredictability, competitive forces, and unforeseen liabilities, could impact KAI's future earnings and long-term growth.\nInterest rate and Construction: KAI faces significant risks from potential interest rate hikes and a slowdown in construction activity. As a manufacturer of equipment for producing lumber and OSB, KAI's financial performance is closely tied to residential construction levels. Higher long-term interest rates, tightened lending standards, and economic factors like high unemployment could reduce construction activity, negatively impacting KAI’s revenues. Additionally, environmental changes affecting timber supply, reduction in capital expenditures by mills and competitive pressures in the OSB market could further challenge financial stability. In 2023, approximately 21% of KAI’s revenue came from its Wood Processing product line, underscoring its vulnerability to these risks.\nCurrency exchange rates risk: As a multinational corporation, KAI faces significant risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations, impacting its operating income and financial stability. These include translation risk, where foreign subsidiaries' financial results are converted into US dollars, and transaction risk, involving gains or losses from holding US dollar assets or liabilities. While KAI’s subsidiaries typically match costs and revenues in the same currency, substantial fluctuations can still negatively affect operating results. Currency devaluations, such as China’s renminbi, further impact consolidated revenue. Despite using hedging strategies, these measures can be costly and not always effective, leaving KAI vulnerable to currency movements in key markets like Europe, China, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico.\nCompetitive market risk: KAI faces significant competitive risks across all its markets, requiring ongoing investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service, and distribution networks. Increased competition, especially in China, challenges KAI as new companies enter the market and existing competitors expand. In the Flow Control segment, KAI competes globally and locally, while in the Industrial Processing segment, it faces both global and regional competitors. Even the OSB market is highly competitive and concentrated, with significant risks if major customers reduce spending or switch to competitors or alternatives like non-fiber-based materials.\n",

The increase has helped support higher direct auto loan originations, lowered loss severity upon repossession, and, in our opinion, has likely created a greater propensity for borrowers to stay current on loans. Should used car prices eventually decline the aforementioned positive impacts could begin to unwind subject to the severity of the prices declines.\nCredit Quality and Loan Underwriting Standards – Credit scores have migrated higher as government stimulus payments have helped borrowers stay current on existing loans and/or pay down debt obligations. Lenders need to remain vigilant in their loan underwriting standards to reflect this upward bias in credit scores.\nCompetition – Competition in the consumer lending business remains intense, particularly in the unsecured loan markets where there are more limited barriers to entry and fintechs have increased their presence.\nInflation – Prices for goods and services have increased notably in recent periods. Price increases could eventually strain consumer budgets, particularly for non-prime customers that tend to live from paycheck to paycheck.\nWholesale Funding – OneMain relies largely on securitizations, unsecured debt issuance, and bank lines to finance its loans which can be more volatile in times of economic stress.\nRegulation – Consumer lending has come under greater regulatory scrutiny, particularly by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

        "Risks": "Municipal spending and economic risk: MWA's end markets are municipal water distribution and treatment systems, the non-residential construction industry, the oil & gas industry and new water and wastewater infrastructure associated with new residential construction. Weakness in these markets, especially municipal, can lower profits. General economic and other factors, including high levels of unemployment and home foreclosures, interest rate fluctuations, fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs, the state of credit markets (including municipal bonds, mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit), weather, natural disasters and other factors beyond the company's control, could adversely affect sales, profitability and cash flows.\nConstruction sector risk: A large part of MWA’s business depends on construction of both non-residential and new residential activity. Non-residential is cyclical; low levels of activity in this market could decrease sales, profitability and cash flow. Also, a section of the business is new residential construction, which is also a cyclical sector. This includes new water and water infrastructure spending. The company used to be highly exposed to the residential construction market, which caused adverse effects with the US economic downturn. In our view, MWA's construction end markets have gone through a very bad recession over the last 5-7 years. We are expecting that over the next 1-5 years these construction markets will normalize and benefit MWA's sales and profits. However, there is no assurance that the US construction sector will stabilize over that period.\nChannel risk: MWA sells most of its products to distributors, who then sell the products to end customers such as residential home builders and municipalities or cities. Success is then dependent on the performance of these key distributors. In 2014, 39% of sales came from the company's 10 largest distributors and 24% came from the two largest. Distribution has experienced consolidation issues in the industry recently. Competitors who have a better relationship with distributors could acquire the company’s distributors. These pressures can also affect pricing and profit margins.\nCompetitive risk: The company operates in a very competitive industry. The US and Canadian markets for water infrastructure and flow control products may only have a few competitors, but each one has a recognized name. Factors that affect competition are quality, price and innovation of product. Marketing becomes increasingly important, so that the company can stay ahead of competitors. The company also faces threats from outside the US market on a global scale. As US competitors shift their businesses to lower-cost countries to reduce costs, competition increases. If competitors reduce their prices it could affect revenue and cash flow of MWA.\nTransportation cost risk: The company has high transportation costs because it has very few manufacturing sites and is generally shipping large and heavy products. The increased distance for transportation and size of container needed to ship the products increases costs for the company. With these high costs, customers could be put off as competitors may be offering cheaper, alternative products. The company uses rail, barge and trucking systems to ship products to customers. Transportation services can be affected by weather-related issues that delay the distribution of products to customers. This then has a negative effect on sales and cash flow.\nLegal risk: MWA receives multiple claims and litigation that could cause results of operations to negatively effected and its reputation to suffer. These claims usually come in the form of damages to products relating to warranties and liability. These lawsuits can distract the management from day-to-day activities and also cause the company significant expenses in defending the cases. The company may also be required to pay damage awards or settlement fees.\n",

While China has had some economic malaise, partly as a consequence of its real estate sector and US pressure on technology and trade, Macau has not been negatively impacted coming out of COVID. However, any economic deterioration, especially if it impacts upper middle class and wealthy Chinese segments could have a negative impact on Macau. Our long-term view is based on our belief that China's GDP growth will continue in mid-single digits (5%-6%), the economy will continue to shift towards greater consumer spend and the numbers of individuals achieving income levels sufficient to visit Macau will continue to grow. Thus, one of the critical risk factors to our Macau view is a deterioration of China's economic backdrop (GDP forecast erosion, loss of stock markets indexes, decline in real estate values, a decrease in consumer confidence and a decrease in disposable income) or a negative liquidity events. Further sector risks include, changes in Chinese consumer attitudes towards gambling, China clampdown on visitation into Macau or clamp down on money movement into Macau, Macau marketing curbs in China, labor union pressures, pandemics that lead to shutdowns of travel, severe climate impact (i.e., typhoons increasing in severity and frequency), taxation changes, and potentially a weakening RMB.\nOur sector outlook for the US casino industry should be discounted by US macro-economic and sector specific risks.

Customers’ cash flow trends determine their upstream capex budgets and those cash flows are partly a function of recent and anticipated commodity prices. Nearly all OFS stocks have exhibited meaningful-to-high positive correlations with the Brent or WTI Crude 12-month strip price over most historical periods.\nMany operators have conflicting priorities that may disrupt or curtail their upstream capex. In the U.S., E&P spending could disappoint due to ongoing consolidation, as newcos tend to take drilling and completion to a level below the combined activity plans of the merged companies; shareholder preferences, as many institutional investors have favored rising FCF generation yields and returns and strengthening balance sheets over restoring a higher rate of reinvestment; and escalating regulatory and cultural ESG pressures, whose manifestation ranges from federal and state policies to university endowment divestment campaigns. Abroad, NOCs (national oil companies) and other parastatal operators may be forced to treat political objectives as paramount and/or financially enervated by government officials.\nLong-term contracts and/or backlog orders may be delayed, changed, cancelled or terminated. In the case of a meaningful contract or award loss, the OFS provider may have to resort to costly, likely lengthy, legal action, without a certainty of success, to try to collect damages. If the counter-party in such an event is an NOC (national oil company), there be little-to-no effective recourse.\nBig project timelines often begin later and/or extend longer than expected. From an initial FEED study to major equipment awards to final installation, each milestone for a sizeable oil & gas development project is susceptible to delays or protraction. An event’s timing can drift out on the calendar by several months, taking it into a later quarter or calendar year than consensus estimates assume.\nSupply chains, shipping, and labor pools are strained around world. Myriad companies are contending with shortages of everything from semi-conductor components to raw materials, such as resin. There are shipping bottlenecks with key ports experiencing congestion.

FELE sells into a variety of end markets and geographic regions. The company’s end markets tend to be cyclical and are sensitive to broad economic conditions in the United States and emerging market regions. FELE faces competition while bidding for projects from peers in the industry. Competition, particularly in difficult markets, can put downward pressure on FELE’s volumes and profitability.\nPolitical risk. FELE is exposed to numerous political and economic risks such as: volatility in political, social and economic conditions, including the effects of civil unrest and sanctions imposed by the United States and other governments. The effects of civil unrest on the company’s business operations, customers and employees may create fluctuations in business activity, such as that recently occurring in the Middle East. Changing tax rates, exchange controls and other similar measures that result in restrictions on repatriation of capital and/or income can have adverse effect on FELE’s P&L.\nSeasonality risk. FELE’s Water Systems business is typically affected by periods of stronger demand in the summer months, from April to August in the United States and Europe as warmer weather conditions influence stronger construction activity. In addition to seasonal trends, FELE benefits from weather-related disasters such as heavy flooding and drought, which can increase demand for water pumping products.\nEnvironmental risk/regulatory risk. FELE is subject to risk regarding environmental, health and safety laws and regulations across the various national, state, provisional and local jurisdictions it operates within. Changing regulations regarding utilities, municipal spending could have an impact on FELE’s future business.\nCurrency risk.

        "Risks": "Commodity price volatility and downtrends. A sudden plunge or sustained decline in oil prices could hurt the company’s stock and, eventually, harm its fundamentals. Customers’ cash flow trends determine their upstream capex budgets and those cash flows are partly a function of recent and anticipated commodity prices. Nearly all OFS stocks have exhibited meaningful-to-high positive correlations with the Brent or WTI Crude 12-month strip price over most historical periods.\nMany operators have conflicting priorities that may disrupt or curtail their upstream capex. In the U.S., E&P spending could disappoint due to ongoing consolidation, as newcos tend to take drilling and completion to a level below the combined activity plans of the merged companies; shareholder preferences, as many institutional investors have favored rising FCF generation yields and returns and strengthening balance sheets over restoring a higher rate of reinvestment; and escalating political and public ESG pressures, whose manifestation ranges from government policies to university endowment divestment campaigns.\nSupply chains, shipping networks, and labor pools are strained around world. Myriad companies are contending with shortages of everything from semi-conductor components to raw materials, such as resin. There are shipping bottlenecks with key ports experiencing congestion. Finally, the OFS complex may struggle to rehire, recruit, and retain skilled veterans, as other industries, such as construction and telecom, absorbed laid-off oilfield workers during the downturn and, for some, offer attractive alternatives.\nHydraulic fracturing is subject to regulatory, legal, and environmental protection risks. At any U.S. well site, the pressure pumping industry and its customers must operate within a multi-level framework of ESH (environmental, safety, and healthy) laws and regulations, from the federal level down to the local. Navigating these frameworks could result in negative outcomes, ranging from increased compliance costs to expensive lawsuits and/or onerous liabilities, that would adversely affect PFHC’s business and financial position. In addition, U.S. Shale development depends on the ample availability of water and access to specific territory, which can overlap with areas of wildlife concern. New and/or increased restrictions on drilling activity to protect certain habitats; or on the ability to source usable water and/or dispose of waste water, including via injection into SWDs; could materially harm PFCH’s earnings potential.\nThe entire oil & gas sector is vulnerable to myriad threats stemming from climate change. This includes risks pertaining to government policies and actions aimed at constraining the advance and/or mitigating the consequences of global warming.\nThe U.S. hydraulic fracturing market remains highly fragmented. The U.S.’s four largest pressure pumpers – HAL, LBRT, NEX, and PFHC – form what we consider the market’s top tier and collectively control 60% of the industry’s HHP (hydraulic horsepower). Over 20 different companies own the remaining 40% of capacity. If enough pumpers are able and willing to invest in significant fleet expansion and/or adopt aggressive bidding tactics, then contract pricing and/or terms could deteriorate at every tier of the market, including the top one.\nThe Wilks brothers and entities they own collectively hold 84.8% of voting stock. Conflicts could arise between Dan and Farris Wilks and their controlled entities, on one hand, and the rest of PFHC’s shareholders, on the other, pertaining to strategy, capital allocation policy and preferences, M&A transactions, and other aspects of business. These principal shareholders could also opt to monetize portions of their stakes in a way that could exert downward pressure on the stock.\nPFHC significantly levered up for the acquisition of FTS International (FTSI). We expect PFHC to exit 2Q22 with net debt of $396MM, reflecting both the borrowing and subsequent refinancing associated with the all-cash purchase of FTSI and the proceeds from the company’s IPO. In March of 2022, S&P assigned PFHC a ‘B’ Issuer Credit Rating and a ‘BB-‘ Secured Credit Rating on its term loan; and Moody’s granted PFHC a ‘B3’ Issuer Credit Rating with a Stable outlook.\nFlotek (FTK) supply agreement includes a minimum annual volume commitment. Pursuant to it, should PFHC fail to purchase the minimum amount, the company must pay FTK liquidated damages equal to 25% of the shortfall for that year. In a scenario in which zero chemicals are purchased over a full year, PFHC estimates that it would have to make a shortfall payment of $40MM for that year.\n",

        "Risks": "Decline in U.S. used vehicle sales: A decline in U.S. used vehicle sales would unfavorably impact CarMax’s sales and earnings. However, we are reassured by the fact that historically, used vehicle sales have been less volatile than new car sales. In addition, any volatility should be tempered by the fact that CarMax continues to gain market share in the segment and continues to profitably grow its store base.\nChanges in used vehicle values: Sharp movements in used vehicle values, either increases or decreases, would favorably/unfavorably impact the value of the company’s inventory, and therefore, gross margins. However, over the long run, changes in used vehicle values should have little impact on the company, as both its revenue and cost of goods sold are impacted similarly by changes in this regard.\nIncreased competition in the used vehicle retail market: Competition has increased in the used vehicle sales space as new vehicle retailers came to realize the benefits of the used vehicle retail market during the downturn - that it is larger, less volatile and that margins are higher. Most auto retailers are now intent on growing their used vehicle businesses, with Sonic Automotive (SAH), AutoNation (AN) and Penske Automotive (PAG) all building out their stand alone used superstore footprints. And of course, online competitors Carvana (CVNA), Vroom (VRM) and Shift (SFT), all of which are growing quickly. While each of these competitors is notable, the market is potentially large enough for several of these players to co-exist successfully.\nIncrease in interest rates and/or reduced availability of capital: To fund loans, the company could potentially have to seek alternate sources of higher cost funding. However, during the financial crises, ABS markets remained open and credit availability was not an issue for the company. In periods of rising rates, interest rate spreads will tend to contract, and conversely, widen during periods of declining rates. However, we believe that over the long term, interest rate spreads of 400-500 bps can be maintained. The company, in fact, maintained such spreads during the financial crisis, and during the most recent bout if rising rates 2016-2019.\nLimited/reduced supply of used vehicle inventory: During the financial crisis, consumers tended to hold their vehicles for longer, reducing the supply of used vehicles. For example, CarMax typically sources 40-50% of its inventory from consumers looking to sell their vehicles -- that dropped to 30% during the downturn, forcing CarMax to buy further into the auction markets, which pressured margins.\n",

Nonetheless, this strategy can generate risk around overpayment, overestimation of synergies, integration, and high levels of indebtedness. HUN also has a relatively low EV/EBITDA valuation, making it more challenging to create value when it makes acquisitions at higher multiples.\nHighly competitive environment. HUN participates in some commodity markets in which competitors can produce at lower cost, or make advancements in innovation that could put HUN at a disadvantage. Barriers to entry are low in some cases, and new competitors could negatively impact HUN’s margin structure or market share. Petroleum-producing countries entering petrochemical markets bear watching.\nRegulatory risk. HUN is subject to extensive regulations around environmental, health, and safety that could restrict its ability to operate or impose higher costs on its operations.

        "Risks": "LCOE is an imperfect tool for comparing the unit costs of different power sources. The LOCE (levelized cost of electricity) is the NPV (net present value) of the unit-cost of electricity over the lifetime of a power generation system. The formula’s output represents the average revenue-per-unit of electricity (i.e. MWh) that a given type of power plant would have to earn in order to recover the sum of its capex and lifetime operating costs, usually assuming a plant service span of 20-to-40 years. Many positive outlooks for onshore turbine growth are heavily predicated on LCOE trends and analytics, which suggest that unsubsidized onshore wind has become increasingly competitive with conventional power sources, such as coal-fired and CCTG plants. Among other flaws, the LCOE oversimplifies costs; oversimplifies or simply misses project context; ignores flexibility considerations, such as whether backup thermal power or stationary storage are needed; and masks regional variability when applied to projects in different countries, according to Sakhi Shah (Energy for Growth Hub) and Morgan Bazilian (Payne Institute). The formula is also highly-sensitive to the capacity factor assumption.\nUltimate implications of Moss Landing outage investigation uncertain. On 9/4/21, Vistra Corp. experienced an overheating issue with a limited number of battery modules within the Phase 1 system at its Moss Landing Energy Storage site. For the facility, Vistra used FLNC as the engineering contractor and batteries manufactured by LG. Root cause analysis is ongoing. In its latest update on 9/30/21, Vistra stated “Our investigation…includes evaluation of multiple systems, including the battery, control, communications, ventilation, and safety systems. One are of focus is whether the water-based heat suppression systems in the facility was activated by smoke in the building unrelated to the batteries themselves.”\nExecution risk. The company has a limited history and its growth is dependent on securing new customers and new orders with existing customers. The company could experience delays, disruptions, or quality issues in its manufacturing process as it relies on third-party suppliers and manufacturers. Failure to execute on its growth strategy and/or operations could have a materially adverse impact on the company's results.\nCustomer risk. Fluence sells products and services to utilities, developers, and commercial and industrial customers, most of which have stringent technical requirements and require long sales/qualification cycles. Implementation may require complex integration plans that require significant technical customization and/or certification to complete, which could result in delays in projects or changes to the scope of projects that could result in adverse changes to our estimates. In prior years, the company's top five customers accounted for as much as 90% of revenue. A loss of one or more customers could have a materially negative impact on the company's financials.\nGovernment and international risk. The company has customers in APAC, EMEA, and the Americas, and therefore is subject to various government regulations and permits, including local, state, national and international laws. The company is also subject to taxes, duties, tariffs, and other import/export charges. Changes in currencies can also impact the company's financials. Political, social, or economic instability in any of these regions could have a material adverse impact on results.\nTechnology and competitive risk. Renewable technology is evolving and the company's success is dependent upon adoption of its proprietary solutions. Competing solutions could emerge and inhibit the company's growth strategy. The company must continuously invest in developing new technologies and service offerings to compete effectively and maintain customer satisfaction. The company also depends on intellectual property which, if not properly protected, could lead to competitors rapidly developing and commercializing similar technology.\nFinancial and strategic risk. The company has operated with a history of losses and therefore may look to raise capital in the future to fund operations, working capital, or pursue strategic initiatives. The company may look to raise capital or pursue mergers and acquisitions which could have a material impact on the company's results and outlook. These initiatives could be dilutive to shareholders.\nInflation and commodity risk. The company's products are made from raw materials that are sourced from various suppliers and regions. These materials include but are not limited to metals, plastics, semiconductors and other electronics, which are subject to supply/demand fluctuations and inflationary pressure.\nAES and Siemens risk. Fluence was established in January 2018 as a joint venture between Seimens and AES. A significant portion of the company's sales were direct sales to AES or a result of its Siemens sales relationship. If the company fails to maintain these relationships it could have a negative impact on its outlook.\nHealth and weather risk. Like most companies, Fluence is subject risk from significant changes in weather which could impact the supply chain and/or manufacturing and service capabilities. Similarly, the company is subject to risk from public health epidemics such as the current global pandemic from COVID-19 which could disrupt staffing, sourcing, and delivery of goods and services.\n",

Nearly all OFS stocks have exhibited meaningful-to-high positive correlations with the Brent or WTI Crude 12-month strip price over most historical periods.\nMany operators have conflicting priorities that may disrupt or curtail their upstream capex. In the U.S., E&P spending could disappoint due to ongoing consolidation, as newcos tend to take drilling and completion to a level below the combined activity plans of the merged companies; shareholder preferences, as many institutional investors have favored rising FCF generation yields and returns and strengthening balance sheets over restoring a higher rate of reinvestment; and escalating political and public ESG pressures, whose manifestation ranges from government policies to university endowment divestment campaigns.\nSupply chains, shipping networks, and labor pools are strained around world. Myriad companies are contending with shortages of everything from semi-conductor components to raw materials, such as resin. There are shipping bottlenecks with key ports experiencing congestion. Finally, the OFS complex may struggle to rehire, recruit, and retain skilled veterans, as other industries, such as construction and telecom, absorbed laid-off oilfield workers during the downturn and, for some, offer attractive alternatives.\nSchlumberger is the largest shareholder with a massive minority stake.

        "Risks": "LCOE is an imperfect tool for comparing the unit costs of different power sources. The LOCE (levelized cost of electricity) is the NPV (net present value) of the unit-cost of electricity over the lifetime of a power generation system. The formula’s output represents the average revenue-per-unit of electricity (i.e. MWh) that a given type of power plant would have to earn in order to recover the sum of its capex and lifetime operating costs, usually assuming a plant service span of 20-to-40 years. Many positive outlooks for onshore turbine growth are heavily predicated on LCOE trends and analytics, which suggest that unsubsidized onshore wind has become increasingly competitive with conventional power sources, such as coal-fired and CCTG plants. Among other flaws, the LCOE oversimplifies costs; oversimplifies or simply misses project context; ignores flexibility considerations, such as whether backup thermal power or stationary storage are needed; and masks regional variability when applied to projects in different countries, according to Sakhi Shah (Energy for Growth Hub) and Morgan Bazilian (Payne Institute). The formula is also highly-sensitive to the capacity factor assumption.\nEOSE is an emerging growth company with negligible revenue history. The company only recognized its first sales in 3Q 2020. EOSE reported zero revenue for 1H 2020.\nEOSE’s production capacity ramp may suffer setbacks, delays, and/or quality control issues.\nTo finance future growth investments, EOSE may issue dilutive new equity. The company intends to expand its annual manufacturing capacity to 7 GWh by 2024, which will require total capex that far exceeds our aggregate CFFO projection for the next three years. In addition,\nLIBs may achieve greater or faster cost reductions than EOSE’s profitability plan anticipates. EOSE plans to price its Zynth storage solutions in line with comparable lithium-ion battery (LIB) options. But, rival LIB manufacturers may achieve cost improvements that allow for profitable pricing at levels below where EOSE can expect to realize positive margins.\nProjects, especially larger ones, may fail to advance as scheduled or indicated. Consistent with other types of undertakings throughout the energy and industrial sectors, utility-scale storage projects may be suspended, postponed, sent back to the drawing board or otherwise revised, or simply slide out to the right. We think the risk of calendar slippage is particularly high.\n",

While China has had some economic malaise, partly as a consequence of its real estate sector and US pressure on technology and trade, Macau has not been negatively impacted coming out of COVID. However, any economic deterioration, especially if it impacts upper middle class and wealthy Chinese segments could have a negative impact on Macau. Our long-term view is based on our belief that China's GDP growth will continue in mid-single digits (5%-6%), the economy will continue to shift towards greater consumer spend and the numbers of individuals achieving income levels sufficient to visit Macau will continue to grow. Thus, one of the critical risk factors to our Macau view is a deterioration of China's economic backdrop (GDP forecast erosion, loss of stock markets indexes, decline in real estate values, a decrease in consumer confidence and a decrease in disposable income) or a negative liquidity events. Further sector risks include, changes in Chinese consumer attitudes towards gambling, China clampdown on visitation into Macau or clamp down on money movement into Macau, Macau marketing curbs in China, labor union pressures, pandemics that lead to shutdowns of travel, severe climate impact (i.e., typhoons increasing in severity and frequency), taxation changes, and potentially a weakening RMB.\nOur sector outlook for the US casino industry should be discounted by US macro-economic and sector specific risks. Our view is based on our belief that US GDP growth will continue to be stable (in low-single digits) and consumers will continue to favor experiential spend and travel. Thus, one of the critical risk factors to our view is any deterioration of economic backdrop in the US (recession, unemployment, declines in equity markets or housing, a decrease in consumer confidence and a decrease in disposable income). Further sector risks include, changes in consumer attitudes towards gambling, and the risks of over development/saturation in certain markets – in that new properties that come online simply cannibalize old properties shares. Finally, any expansion of iGaming could have some headwinds to existing land-based casino businesses in those markets. For Las Vegas specifically, risks include significant changes in fuel costs (for both ground and air transportation), share shifts in the convention market (convention shift to other US markets), high pricing in rooms, travel, F&B and other activities could lead to customers being priced out of the market.\nFor MGM, company specific downside risks include:\n",
